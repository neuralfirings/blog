    <p>I got my custom PCBs from iTEAD last week. So exciting, right?</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/07/pcbmotor_pcbs.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I plugged everything in and‚Ä¶. WARHN warhn (failure horn üì¢).</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/07/failwhale.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>So much trouble trying to figure out what‚Äôs the issue. The LED would sometimes turn on, sometimes it wouldn‚Äôt, sometimes the LED would turn on and stay on. I think this indicated that the ESP8266 was frozen. The motor would work maybe 10% of the time. And it was all completely random. I checked my soldering for loose connections. Resoldered a few suspicious (but I think they were fine) connections. Poke and prodded this little green thing with my <a href="http://amzn.to/1MuPvhT">multimeter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="root-cause-i-think-maybe">Root Cause (I think? Maybe?)</h2>

<p>I suspect it‚Äôs had something to do with my 5V Regulator. It seems to be working off a lot of heat. I didn‚Äôt have a heat sink for it. Trying to debug it let me all over the place. Sometimes it would give me a steady 5V (or 4.9V), other times it would putt along at a 4.2V. I suspect this might be because my 9V battery was losing too much juice too quickly. The 5V Regulator I used (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2164">7805 TO-220</a>) needs a minimum of 7V to output a consistent 5V, according to Adafruit product description. So 4.2V output is no go since the L293D motor driver has a minimum supply voltage of 4.5V (and a max of 36!) so that was a no go.</p>

<p>The other problem was my LED. I got some LED that came with built in resistors, but I think when I soldered them in I soldered them above where the resistor were. So I had to redo the LED. I used a handy white LED the second time since white LEDs have the highest forward voltage. I ended up tearing up the copper traces during this ‚Äúfix‚Äù and had to solder in wires manually (see pic below).</p>

<h2 id="solution-ish">Solution (ish)</h2>

<p>To solve the 5V Regulator problem I decided to just F it and use a different battery pack. I got out my handy 4 AA battery. This starts at a 6V and works its way down to a 4.4V. With a fresh set of batteries it‚Äôs a little too high for the ATtiny85 chip, which has a max supply voltage of 5.5V. However, it doesn‚Äôt stay at 6V for long and the batteries I‚Äôm using is definitely not at 6V. I then added a manual wire connection between the Input on the 5V regulator and the VCC on the L293D chip. Basically, I bypassed the 5V regulator and plugged the power source directly onto the ATtiny85 and L293D Motor Driver.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/07/pcbmotor_hack_comments.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs probably not the safest or the smartest thing to do. BUT IT WORKS! It‚Äôs so beautiful it works. And it‚Äôs tidy.</p>

<p><strong>Before (breadboard):</strong>
<img src="/content/images/2015/07/pcbmotor_prepcb.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>After (custom PCB):</strong>
<img src="/content/images/2015/07/pcbmotor_setup.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So tidy. Much tiny.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>To get these components in their comfortable range of operation, I‚Äôll try routing the ESP8266 (&amp; LED) and ATtiny85 through a 3V Regulator and leave the L293D Motor Driver (&amp; Stepper Motor) directly connected to the 9V Battery.</p>

<table style="font-size: 0.7em">
<tr><th>Component</th><th>Min Supply Voltage</th><th>Max Supply Voltage</th><th>Current Power</th><th>Proposed Power</th></tr>

<tr><td>LED</td><td>2.5V</td><td>3.2V</td>&lt;td colspan=2 style="text-align: center"&gt;ESP8266 (3.2 V on HIGH)</tr>

</table>

<h2 id="also-next-steps">Also Next Steps</h2>

<p>Rather than waiting another two weeks to get a PCB, I‚Äôm researching how to etch my own PCB at home. It seems like a huge hassle, but I figure it‚Äôs probably worth being able to rapidly prototyping board after board.</p>

<p>The problem is I‚Äôm woefully undersupply. I looked into it, and I‚Äôll need something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drill press (for the through holes and vias)</li>
  <li>Feric Chloride (sp?) for etching away the copper</li>
  <li>FR4 Copper Boards</li>
  <li>Safety stuff: gloves, goggles, work mask</li>
  <li>Laser printer (or more chemicals that I‚Äôll probably splash on things I shouldn‚Äôt splash weird chemicals on. Like <a href="http://ajaxthedog.com">my dog</a>)</li>
  <li>Some tool to cut the FR4 material</li>
</ul>

<p>If I want to get fancy, I might need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Laminator</li>
  <li>A bunch of sheets that does fancy transfer things</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems like a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?</p>
