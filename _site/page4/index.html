    <div class="box-danger">
PLEASE NOTE: I've written a <a href="http://blog.nyl.io/hello-world-custom-pcb-fritzing/">new and improved version of this guide</a>.<br /><br />Yeah! Updates!!</div>

<p>We’ve all see something like this before.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/v2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The simple breadboard with a messy, beautiful rainbow of wires sticking this way and that. This part of <a href="http://blog.nyl.io/dog-treat-dispenser-v3/">a project</a> is where I control a stepper motor, which tells the dispenser to twist the fan looking thing and dispense a treat. Luckily, Adafruit has published <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-10-stepper-motors/overview">this exact tutorial</a>. So I followed the Adafruit tutorial and plugged in a whole bunch of wires where the tutorial told me to plug. Easy enough! But now, how does one tidy things up?</p>

<p>Why, <strong>printed circuit boards</strong>, of course! You know, those green things with lines all over them. Don’t worry. It’s not that hard.</p>

<h2 id="meet-fritzing-your-friendly-pcb-designer">Meet Fritzing, your friendly PCB designer</h2>

<p><a href="http://fritzing.org/download/">Fritzing</a> is kind of like LEGOs of PCB design. It’s simple, good for learning. A stepping stone to Eagle or KiCAD.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-virtual-breadboard">Step 1: Virtual Breadboard</h3>

<p>This is my favorite part of Fritzing. As a novice hardware hacker, it helps that I start with something I already have working: breadboards and jumper wires.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/06/fritzing_breadboard-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With Fritzing, you start with a virtual breadboard set up. Click the “Breadboard” tab. Here, you can search for various components, like “breadboard” and “Raspberry Pi” and “L293D” (the motor driver I used).</p>

<p>Add components to the workspace. Then click to start dragging wires around. Protip: press the control (Windows) or cmd (Mac) key to make the wires all bendy… just like in real life.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-schematics">Step 2: Schematics</h3>

<p>If you switch to the Schematics tab, you’ll see an outline of the schematics. But… I didn’t really deal with this view very much. So let’s skip it. =P</p>

<h3 id="step-3-pcb">Step 3: PCB</h3>

<p>Now we get to the fun part! When you open up the PCB view, you should see something like this.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/fritzing_pcb-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is just the components you selected. Well, they are holes to plug in the components you selected.</p>

<p>The dotted lines represent where the connections should go. Our goal is to turn these dotted line (airwires) into routes. To do this, just drag a dotted line into place.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/Pasted_Image_6_25_15__1_15_AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The goal is to create a board without any routes criss crossing with another route. That would be bad. Electricity would ram into one another and we will not have a good time.</p>

<p>One way to tackle this is to use multiple layers. For me, 2 layers was sufficient to route all the airwires without anything crossing.</p>

<p>To connect a route on the top layer with one on the bottom layer, you use via. As in, go from top to bottom via this connection. To do this add a bend point by right clicking on route then clicking “Add a Bendpoint.” Then, right click on the bend point and choose “Convert Bendpoint to Via.” Then you can right click on different parts of the route to move between layers.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/Pasted_Image_6_25_15__1_19_AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually, all your routes come together nice and cleanly. You can check that your routes are indeed error free by using the nifty design checker (Tool Bar &gt; Route &gt; Design Rule Check).</p>

<p>I ended up with something like this.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/Pasted_Image_6_25_15__1_25_AM-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The dots on top is just a marking I made to tell me which pins I need to solder. Or more importantly, which pins I can use as practice. My soldering skills are… lacking.</p>

<p>You can add text (like the dots or the “badwolf v3” in the bottom left) by searching for “silkscreen” under the Parts section in the right toolbar.</p>

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>

<p>Now that we have a PCB sketch, let’s get to making.</p>

<p>What I ended up doing is exporting to Gerber files. It’s a series of files that tells the machine where to drill holes, how to label things, and of course where to put down the copper so your precious electricity can flow to their rightful homes.</p>

<p>You can preview your Gerber files to make sure they work using <a href="http://www.gerblook.org">GerbLook</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pcb-prototyping-companies">PCB Prototyping Companies</h3>

<p>I did a few searches, and found some good options. This is based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shipping to Seattle</li>
  <li>2 layer board</li>
  <li>board that measures 1.5x1.75 in<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Actual mileage may vary depending on your design.</p>

In the US, the fastest/cheapest seem to be OSHPark if you have small boards. OSHPark (stands for open source hardware park) charges by the square inch. So if you have a tinyass board like my dog treat thing, it's only $12 or less. If you have a 3x3in<sup>2</sup> board though, it's $45, even though each side only doubled in length. Yay. Behold the power of exponents. 

I ordered from ITEAD. Paid a little extra for DHL Express. Still, it came down to about $3/PCB since they ship 10 QTY. I did end up having to use an extra PCB because I'm apparently the kind of idiot who solders things backwards the first time around.

Not bad, eh? 

Ok. Now go and make stuff.

        Internet Dog Treat Dispenser (v3)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>Once upon a time, a few dog people (people who love dogs, not dog+people hybrids) made a remote controlled dog treat dispenser. You know, because that’s what dog people do at hackathons. Things like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://ajaxthedog.com/post/29945882455/"><img src="/content/images/2015/06/v1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It dispenses treats with a text message. The Arduino is connected to the computer, which listens for the text.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.nyl.io/remote-dog-treat-dispenser-v2/">Version 2</a> was a little tidier. We made it using a Raspberry Pi instead of a computer, which meant it didn’t have to be tethered to a computer. It plugs right into a an USB wall output or battery pack.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/v2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, V2 was nice and dandy, but it was still messy. I mean, look at all those wires. So I decided to fix that. By making a custom PCB (printed circuit board). I mean, <strong>how hard can it be?</strong></p>

<p>It turns out: <strong>not that hard!</strong> Nowadays, with better software, the internet to connect you with manufacturers, it’s getting easier and easier.</p>

<h2 id="v3-internet-dog-treat-dispenser">V3: Internet Dog Treat Dispenser</h2>

<p>For the electronics, I used <a href="http://fritzing.org/home/">Fritzing</a>, which is an open source, free schematics and PCB designer. I like it because you start with a visual representation of the breadboard, Raspberry PI, and whatever components. You drag and drop the exact components you need and wire it up exactly how you’d wire it up in real life. From there, the virtual wiring turns into schematics and PCB layout.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-real-world">Step 1: Real World</h3>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/v2_realworld.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="step-2-virtual-bread-board">Step 2: Virtual Bread Board</h3>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/fritzing_breadboard-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="step-3-pcb">Step 3: PCB!</h3>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/fritzing_pcb.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Routing the PCB was kind of fun, like solving a puzzle.</p>

<p>Fritzing exports to Gerber files, which most PCB manufacturers take. I spent a little while Googling around for cheap PCB prototypers (low volume, relatively quick turnaround). I ended up using <a href="http://imall.iteadstudio.com/">ITEAD</a> in Shenzhen. For a PCB of this size (1.5x1.75 inches), they will produce 10 QTY for $10. Not a bad deal.</p>

<p>For a more detailed write up of how I made Custom PCBs, check out <a href="http://blog.nyl.io/making-custom-pcbs/">this blog post</a>. The Fritzing and Gerber files are available on <a href="https://github.com/neuralfirings/badwolf">this project’s GitHub Page</a>.</p>

<p>There were a few places that had cheap PCBs, most of them are based in China. The kicker is the shipping. The main reason I went with ITEAD was because they offered the “cheapest” expedited shipping options–$18 for DHL Express 3 Days.</p>

<p>Fast forward a week (it took them 6 business days from order to delivery!), I got a fresh pack of custom PCBs from China!!</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/01_boards.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A few headers here, a few <small>crappy</small> soldering there…</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/02_boardassembly.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="bam-electronics">BAM! ELECTRONICS!</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/03_board.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One end has a 13x2 pin Raspberry Pi header. There’s also 6 positive headers sticking out for the stepper motor. So, plug it into a Raspberry Pi, which is sitting in a cushy 3D printed box. Then plug the stepper motor into the PCB..</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/04_plugitin.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Add some more 3D printed parts (all designed in <a href="http://blender.org">Blender</a> by the way)</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/05_fan.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Woo!!! Remote control dog (or human) treat dispenser!!!</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/06a_openlid.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One USB connects to a webcam, and a micro USB connects to power. Best of all? No messy wires, no scotch tape.</p>

<p>It comes with a nifty web interface, so you can see and hear a live stream of your nice or naughty pet. Give treats according.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/09_screenshot.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/06/07_dispense_open_lo.gif" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<p>Then put the lid on, and you’re ready to rumble.</p>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2015</span>

    <p>Every year or so, I test out some new blogging platform. It’s fun, I suppose. Trying out new technology. For a little over a year, I’ve been writing on <a href="http://medium.com/@nliang">Medium</a>. It was easy. They had a nice interface, and showed promise of traffic and readership.</p>

<p>They had a nice interface, but ultimately not the one I need. I liked that the editor mirrors the final product. There is no need for preview because the preview is what you see as you write. As I tried to write more, I started using other editors like iA Writer, which used markup. As I got close to publishing, I copy pasted what I wrote in markup over to Medium and spent time tidying up the formatting. In the end, the more I wrote, the less I used the nice interface.</p>

<p>I also looked at traffic. For the most part, traffic came from outside Medium. External blogs that referred to my article, Twitter, Facebook. There were a few that came from recommends and Medium-related medium (hehe), but not enough to really make a difference.</p>

<p>In the end, Medium was a nice experiment. But I think it’s time to pull my content to my own domain. Also, it was about time for me to trying some new (or old) blogging and writing platform again. That part is the fun part.</p>

<p>In the end, I choose <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> paired with my own domain. It’s markup based, which suits the tools I use to write. It has an active community. The developers seem to publish regular updates. And it’s focused around blogging, which is nice.</p>

<p>Now that I write these reasons, it all seems so simple. But it’s hard to do. Having an active community and publishing regular updates. Both of these are so simple yet difficult at the same time. I suppose that’s what makes it worthwhile.</p>

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2015</span>

    <p>I once heard of a concert pianist who prepare for concerts by reading the scores. On the plane ride over to a particular concert, he will look at the score and think about how to approach the piece. When he arrives, he just plays. The practice happens all in his head.</p>

<p>How does he do it? How does he encounter some of the most difficult pieces in the piano repetoire and sight read it as though it were nothing?</p>

<p>My theory is that through his career, he’s played enough pieces to recognize patterns better than the rest of us. It’s like reading. When you start to learn to read, you piece out one letter at a time. Then eventually you start recognizing parts of words, you piece out “to+ge+ther.” With more practice, you start digesting whole words and even whole phrases. When you skim a paragraph, you are no longer thinking about individual syllables or letters, but digesting chunks of information at a time<sup id="fnref:n"><a href="#fn:n" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Most people playing piano never advance past the first two stages. When confronted with a new piece, they are still sounding out the music one note at a time. I think when professionals do it, they absorb the music in chunks. The patterns are ingrained after years of practice. The work is how to interpret these patterns in interesting ways.</p>

    <p>You’re live! Nice.</p>

<h1 id="heading-1">Heading 1</h1>
<p>We’ve put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started.</p>

<h2 id="heading-2">Heading 2</h2>
<p>You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>

<h3 id="heading-3-getting-started">Heading 3: Getting Started</h3>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it’s a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<h4 id="heading-4">Heading 4</h4>
<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item number one</li>
  <li>Item number two
    <ul>
      <li>A nested item</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remember to buy some milk</li>
  <li>Drink the milk</li>
  <li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it’ll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here’s a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-images">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo" /></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That’s ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<p>![A bowl of bananas]</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn’t enough, you want to quote someone on what they’ve said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it’s definitely a word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wisdomous - it’s definitely a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="working-with-code">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We’ve got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ready-for-a-break">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you’ve got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="advanced-usage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There’s one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it’ll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>
