    <p>I am old enough to notice the past repeating itself.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I remember some old guy told me that fashion was cyclical. The same styles come back, fade out, and come back again. He said, as you grow old you see these trends cycling through. I don’t consider myself that old, but I guess I am old enough to observe a cycle in the way we produce online content.</p>

<p>When I was in high school, blogs like LiveJournal and Xanga were the way my friends and I produced online content. People posted about their lives, read each other’s blogs, commented. I even met some of my future classmates through our college’s pre-frosh LiveJournal community.</p>

<p>Then sometime during college, that all stopped. Rather than creating original content, we substituted in quick actions. We liked on Facebook, retweeted on Twitter, and reblogged on Tumblr. There was this one button content “creation” phenomena.</p>

<p>We are swinging back. People have gotten tired of the quickie content creation. They yearn for meatier content. I think that is driving the explosion in new blogging sites focused on writing. Whitespaces, no distraction, markdown… anything to make it easy to write meaningful content. I am looking at Ghost, Svbtle, and of course, Medium.</p>

<p>Perhaps to invent the next step is to look back. Revamp some of those crazy ideas of 1990s like web rings and LiveJournal communities, but with a Web 2.0 spin—minimalism, flat design, maybe something with Node.js or Firebase or whatever is the hip new thing on Hacker News.</p>

<p>After all, some of those PowerPoint animations that we made fun of are revamping into jQuery $.fadeIn(). iPhone apps now zoom in and out just like my high school PowerPoints once did. The past comes back. Maybe it disguises itself with a sunglass-mustache-combo, but it does come back.</p>

        Outside my 3D Printed Bubble

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>I went to MIT this weekend for <a href="http://grandhackfest.wordpress.com/">Healthcare’s Grand H@ckfest</a>—and we got first prize! I brought my 3d printer so we can print an physical prototype, and so we did. We designed, hacked, and 3d printed a new medical device in 24 hours.</p>

<p>I figured at a place like MIT, most (if not all) have already seen, hacked apart, rebuilt 3d printers. I figured my 3d printer would be just another random piece of technology strewn about in the hallways.</p>

<p>I was dead wrong. The 3d printer was a hit!</p>

<p>We had a constant stream of people walking by our table to ask about 3d printing, take photos, or just gawk at the machine. While printing late night in my host’s dorm room, her hallmates kept poking their heads in to check out the 3d printer. In Brooklyn, people turned their heads to check out my cute puppy. Here, people turned their heads to check out my 3d printer.</p>

<h2 id="its-easy-for-the-wonder-of-3d-printing-to-get-lost-in-the-day-to-day">It’s easy for the wonder of 3d printing to get lost in the day to day</h2>

<p>This was a good reminder that I live in a 3d printed bubble. People in this bubble spend our time dealing with nozzle clogs, loose wires, buggy CAD software, supply chain, business tax accounting (yes, it’s that time of the year). It’s easy for the wonder of 3d printing to get lost in this day the day.</p>

<p>One student said to me, “you have such an amazing life.” I did a double take. When I think of 3d printing in my day to day business, I think of the sales tax preparation coming up, the retail channel contracts to finalize, the material QA issues to sift through—not so amazing stuff.</p>

<p>It’s good to step out of my bubble. It renews wonder. It sheds new perspective. It validates or invalidates assumptions. I’m glad I had the opportunity to do that this weekend. I’m glad it reminded me to step out of my bubble more often.</p>

        What It's Like to Build a 3D Printer

    <p>Most 3d printers are still hand assembled. The hands might belong to factory workers, or oftentimes, they belong to the end user. Most 3d printer companies sells kits that you then assemble. I’ve actually never done this before, so I found this video quite amusing. It’s a timelaspe of a 30 hour printer assembly project. From unboxing to first print.</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26f7VvKh92Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In my experience, many of the problems that people run across stem from this manual assembly process. Manual assembly leads to more room for error—a slightly off potentiometer, a wiggly thermistor registering inaccurate temperature readings, axis belts not taught. Those are just some of few issues that I’ve personally ran across.</p>

<p>I am not a “hardware person,” so I don’t know how far we are from having 3d printers assembled by machines (more appropriate, no?), with soldered or enclosed parts that don’t wiggle out of place. Of course, it also means the end machine is less hackable, which means the standard of quality has to be magnitudes higher. There is nothing more frustrating than working with a broken machine that I can’t tweak.</p>

        A Printer for Hackers

    <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>The trend today in 3d printing is hitting it big with the consumers. With everyday people. Printer companies are making their printers more and more sleek. The idea of the “one button” push and print is ingrained into many marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>Is that the right strategy?</p>

<p>I’ve been mucking around with the Raspberry Pi today. I am playing around with it, setting up the wifi module, the camera. I have had to fiddle around with it in the same ways I have to fiddle with a desktop 3d printer. I tweaked this setting, I plugged it in, took the plug out, tweaked that setting, rinse and repeat. But it didn’t bother me as much. Because, the Raspberry Pi is a toy for the hackers, it’s a toy that comes with the expectation that you have to tweak, Google, and following all sorts of tutorials to get it working.</p>

<p>I think setting that expectation is important, and might be a better strategy for 3d printing. I’m not saying we shouldn’t try to get consumers to experience 3d printing, but rather tell the story of “making and hacking,” rather than the story of “push and play.” It’s a more honest story, and I think in some sense a more rewarding story.</p>

<p>When you hand somebody a block of clay, the expectation is that they will work to better their craft. It’s not a story of push and play. But the work and the learning to become a better sculptor is just as rewarding, if not more rewarding, than the end result.</p>

<p>I wonder if it should be the same for 3d printing.</p>

        3D Printers and Sewing Machines
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>Slate recently <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/03/solidoodle_4_testing_the_home_3_d_printer.html">published an article about 3d printing</a> in which the author compared it to the sewing machine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider: Once upon a time, people purchased sewing patterns…and they made their own clothes. I wasn’t alive back then, but I’m pretty sure the process sucked. It took lots of time and effort and the clothes were often amateurishly constructed….Most people would much rather just get their clothes from a store—already assembled by people employing industrial-level efficiency and a wide variety of materials.
I like this analogy for two reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-relationship-between-tools-and-crafts">The relationship between tools and crafts.</h3>
<p>Like the sewing machine, 3D printers are ultimately tools. The work a tool produces is as good as the craftsman who uses the tool. I believe eventually this will change, as 3D printing become less about creating than about modifying other’s creations, or simply printing pre-existing designs.</p>

<h3 id="both-are-revolutionary">Both are revolutionary</h3>
<p>The article glosses over this point. In fact, they claim quite the opposite. That sewing machines are used by the few, and most avoid the technology in favor of buying off the rack. However, it is the sewing machines that enable them to buy off the rack. In that sense, sewing machine are revolutionary. I believe so is 3D printing. Though, where as sewing machines enabled mass manufacturing, 3D printing will do quite the opposite—revolutionary nonetheless.</p>
