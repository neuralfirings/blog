        Are Brands Becoming Irrelevant?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>Last Friday, somebody asked me, “what’s your favorite fashion brand?” This question caught me a bit off guard. It’s a perfectly reasonable question, especially since we were at a talk about fashion. And isn’t fashion a world carved out by empires of brands?</p>

<p>I thought about what I like, and it’s not brands that come to mind. I think about styles, silhouettes, colors, lines. Abstract concepts. I think about people whose fashion sense I admire. I don’t know (or care) where they buy their clothes from.</p>

<p>There are a few brands that I like. But, I don’t like these brands for their name. I like these brands because I like their style and I know they have clothes that fit my body. Defaulting to a favorite brand is a cheat sheet, a filtering mechanism. I’ve already evaluated that brand against my standards for style and fit, so if I shop there I know I will find clothes that fit and flatter. It’s not the brand that I love, it’s the style and fit that I love.</p>

<p>Look forwarding, I wonder if other sources will replace brands as the “cheat sheet” for finding good style and fit. Rather than perusing the latest White House Black Market catalogue, I am browsing blogs like Garance Dore or Extra Petite to find inspiration. Or maybe Pinterest and Polyvore will implement some genius AI that recommends outfits based on my boards and likes.</p>

<p>Brands update their collection a few times a year. Magazines publish every month. Blogs, Pinterest, Polyvore publishes new content every second. Talk about fast fashion, right?</p>

    <p>We’ve all worked with these people. Perfectionists. Exacting people who want things done a specific way. Their way. The perfect way.</p>

<p>At least that’s what they hide behind. This idea that they have incredibly high standards, which explains why they are so demanding, of course.</p>

<p>This makes one key assumption: that they know what perfection is.</p>

<p>Now that’s mighty arrogant. Isn’t it?</p>

<p>Me, I prefer experimentation to perfection. Start building, ask questions, and observe the hell out of things. Correct mistakes along the way, and leave identifying perfection to the users. I’m not prescient enough to predict what people may want.</p>

<p>I choose humble experimentation.</p>

    <p>The world is shifting from valuing ownership to valuing accessibility.</p>

<p>I use Kindle to access books. I trim down my bookshelf every year.</p>

<p>I use Wikipedia to access knowledge. I have a bad memory anyway.</p>

<p>To live in this world, I don’t need more space in my brain. I need more RAM and bandwidth.</p>

        Good Design, Bad UX
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>This parking sign project popped up in my newsfeed a few times last week. <a href="http://www.lamayor.org/mayor_garcetti_unveils_new_easy_to_read_parking_signs?recruiter_id=7">LA is piloting this new signage design</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/parkingsigns.png" alt="New Signage Design" /></p>

<p>The two problem with the sign? It’s not usable and it doesn’t address the root cause of the problem. It’s a perfect example of good design, bad user experience (UX).</p>

<h2 id="good-design">Good Design</h2>

<p>I find the visual design quite pleasing.</p>

<p>They used a format that we are all familiar with. The signs are laid out the way our calendar apps display our schedule. Leveraging familiarity is a good design choice.</p>

<p>They use big, bold colors to represent concepts. My eyes like the simplicity.</p>

<p>They trimmed down the sign to the basic questions we all want to know: can I park here and how long? Keep It Simple Stupid.</p>

<h2 id="bad-user-experience">Bad User Experience</h2>

<p>So while the sign is visually pleasant, it doesn’t work for me. By the way, I have driven daily in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan when I lived in NYC.</p>

<p><strong>1. This sign is not safe. (this is kindda important)</strong></p>

<p>In NYC, different street have different hours when you can or can’t park. You can park here from midnight to 6 AM, there from midnight to 3 AM, and the street next to it? 8 AM to 12 PM. It looks like this sign is designed in a way that stretches the hour marks to accommodate for the individual streets. In the other words, the spacing between hour marks on this sign differ from street to street. This means you can’t just glance at a sign to know whether you can park or not. Because of the small font, you need to carefully drive up close and read the sign.</p>

<p>This is dangerous! You want to be able to glance at a sign and then shift your eyes back on the road, where it belongs. After all, this is NYC. You share the road with cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.</p>

<p><strong>2. I’m not convinced this sign solves the problem.</strong></p>

<p>One value proposition is the ability to combine multiple signs into one consolidated sign. I suspect, though, that the totem pole of parking signs is symptomatic of the way goverment works — different departments with disjointed processes. Actually, the most annoying signs are the ad-hoc signs. The ones where they post up a piece of paper or temporary signage for pop up farmers market, on location film and television, or concerts.</p>

<p>Solving the problem of unified signage may not be creating a unified sign, but changing the process of how various organizations get their signage approved in the first place.</p>

<p>UX is not always about making better product, sometimes it’s about better policies and processes.</p>

<h2 id="my-suggestion">My suggestion?</h2>

<p><strong>Integrate with Google Maps and other GPS</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/googlemapsparking.jpeg" alt="Google Maps parking app" /></p>

<p>When I’m traveling to a new place, I usually have Google Maps or some sort of GPS system on. If my GPS tells me ahead of time of where I can park, that would be idea. I wouldn’t have to scour the streets for signage, then spend time reading the sign when I should be focused on the road.</p>

<p>Also, often by the time I read the signage I already missed a good chunk of available parking spots. Then I have to loop around the block and see whether there are any parking space alongside the street.</p>

<p>If Google Maps can help me plan out a “parking finder route,” that would be ideal. I wouldn’t have to even worry about reading signage or plotting routes for how to find parking.</p>

<p>“But what about times when you don’t use Google Maps?”</p>

<p>Valid question. The times when I don’t use Google Maps are times when I travel to places I’m already familiar with. In those cases, I’m usually fairly familiar with where I can park at what time, so I wouldn’t need this feature anyway. Moot!</p>

<p>By the way, this has been <a href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/new-york-city-unveils-parking-app-pilot-program/">piloted</a></p>

<p><strong>Dynamic LCD Displays</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/seattlespeedsigns.jpeg" alt="Seattle Dynamic Speed Signs" /></p>

<p>Dynamic LCD displays that display clearly “yes/no” for parking. In Seattle, some of the speed signs are on interactive displays. The speed limit then can change with the traffic congestion. This is a much more pricey implementation of course. There’s a lot more to manufacture, install, and maintain.</p>

<p>But, imagine if instead of parking signs, there are interactive displays that plainly tells you “2 hrs until 8 PM” or “No parking until 7 PM.” It ignores all the other rules that may not apply, like showing you what Saturday rules when it’s Thursday. Different signage requestors (concertos, schools, road cleaners) can input their rules and it all gets compiled into one unified message.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’m sure my suggestions have their pitfalls as well. And I would love to hear what they are.</p>

<p>Design and UX is a process, a conversation between different parties. So, even though I think the user experience for this “Google Calendar Signage” is bad, the fact that the designer got me to write about it and think about it means they’ve won.</p>

    <p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/monkey-1.jpeg" alt="Curious George" /></p>

<p>I once sat down at a lunch table with some strangers, and we started chit chatting. It was one of those situations where we talked to fill the silence, because awkward noise beats awkward silence. We didn’t have anything meaty to say to each other though. We asked some of the same bland questions you hear over and over again — what do you do, where do you work, what movies do you like. You know, the usual. It was the social equivalent of watching paint dry.</p>

<p>Then, my other friend sat down and started asking questions. And the table came to life. We were suddenly talking about all these cool things we’ve done, and fascinating thoughts we have. It was as though we were different people. Thinking back on the conversation, she asked exactly the same questions — what do you do, where do you work, etc. But there was one, simple difference.</p>

<p>My friend is a genuinely curious human being. She was conversing because she was genuinely curious about the other people at the table.</p>

<p>I think everybody has some nugget of fascination in them. Some people bury these nuggets deep inside, others wear it on their sleeves. Whether I can find these nuggets depends on how good I am at digging. In order to be good at digging, I have to be genuinely curious.</p>

<p>It’s not about knowing the right questions to ask, or following an interview strategy guide. If you are genuinely curious about somebody or something, you will figure out the right questions to ask. Because you have to. Otherwise you won’t scratch your itch. And unscratched itches are unbearable.</p>
