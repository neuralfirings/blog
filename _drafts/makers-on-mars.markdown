# Makers on Mars

I recently stumbled across this series on SpaceX. It dives deep into what is up with that kooky program and why it's so important for humans to live and establish civilization on Mars. 

I believe the Maker Toolkit will become crucial for the first human colony on Mars (or any other planet). A colony is a small group of people. Yes, Elon wants to put one million people on Mars. One million is a pretty big number. However, it's small when you consider you're aiming to build a whole civilization. In 1775, the American Colonies had more than double that--2.4 million people. And that's, you know, back in the "simple days." 

If you think about what it takes to power a civilization today, there's a lot of support behind everything we use around us. For example, let's look at this lamp that I'm using on my table. It's a simple lamp. There's an on/off switch, and this neck that I can move around to shine light on different things. It has a sturdy base. Not that fancy. 

But there was some factory that molded the plastic which covers the lightbulb, another factory that bent the metal which makes up the step and base, another factory that made the lightbulb, another factory that wired everything together so that electricity ends up at the right place and doesn't start fires, another factory that made the cable, another factory that... you get the idea. If you put all those factories together just to create one simple desk lamp, you start to shave off resources (people, machines, housing, etc) from your starter colony quite fast. 

So how do you maximize the utility of that 1 million humanity starter pack? How do you eliminate the need for all those factories, and the factories that support the factories?<small>(you see where I'm going right?)</small>

# Makers! 

Makers can take raw(ish) resources, and transform them into a variety of useful things. This eliminates the need for much of those supporting factories. Supply Shuttles from Earth can become much more efficient, carrying raw materials like plastic, fabric, and sheets of wood and metal. This is much easier than if <a class="tip" data-content="aka Blue Origin">Amazon.space</a> had to organize how many lamps, mugs, tables, etc. it needs to send out to space.
