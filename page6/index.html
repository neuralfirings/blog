    <p>This past weekend, a game developer (friend of a friend) showed me his workspace. It’s an environment like I’ve never seen before. The layout was open and the room was dark, apparently good for seeing graphics on a computer screen. No walls. But very quiet.</p>

<p>It got me to start thinking: what are the ways environment affect the way people operate?</p>

<p>I’m not just talking about office layout. But also things like background music, art on walls, the temperature of your coffee, access to food, material of your desk and chair. So many of these little non-personal cues poke and prod us to behave one way or the other. It’s a bit unsettling, right? These little invisible forces controlling some aspect of our lives.</p>

        The Green State
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>In 3D printing processes like Stainless Steel and Ceramics, there is a Green State during the production process. During this part, the model is very brittle and fragile. The part needs to be dug out of its powder bed before put into the kiln. Because there is force coming from the air gun, brushes, and general handling, the more fragile models often break in this stage. Eventually, the parts are baked in a kiln and hardens, which strengthens the final product you receive.</p>

<p>When introducing designers to 3D printing, I found it helpful start by explaining this process. Though they may not have years and years of engineering training, we all have practice experience with physics to know how things break under pressure. Understanding the manufacturing process is key to understanding design.</p>

<p>Of course, this goes beyond just 3D printing. Understanding people requires us to understand their thought process. Understanding how companies requires us to understanding how organizational processes work. Even more than understanding, we need to identify these Green State(s), and then either design around or directly address those states.</p>

<p>But alas, how people think and how companies work are more complex than manufacturing processes. And manufacturing processes are already mighty complex. I suppose that’s what makes things interesting. And frustrating. Mostly interesting. 70/30.</p>

    <p>I was in a discussion about interviewing strategies and the merits of behavioral questions versus hypothetical questions.</p>

<p>Behavioral questions start with “Tell me about a time when…”</p>

<p>Hypothetical questions start with “What would you do if…” Hypothetical questions frustrate me for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s easy to say I would do this or that. It’s hard to actually do the things you want to do.</li>
  <li>Even if you execute what you want to do, it’s hard to predict what you would want to do in a specific situation. Little situational details may change your wants — the weather, who interacts with you, how you feel about a specific argument or pain point.</li>
  <li>It’s hard for the interviewer to give all the information needed to present a fully fleshed out situation. Context is important, and interviewers often leave out little big details in hypothetical scenarios.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s more interesting and useful to start from the facts and work backwards: what people actually did, how they actually behaved. Then ask, what does that say about how they think. Then finally, how does that predict how people would behave in the future.</p>

    <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>In the last two Blender updates, the Grease Pencil tool got a major facelift. The Grease Pencil was traditionally used for annotating 3D drawings. Now, it can also be used for animation.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender-3dp.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>And if you are a better drawer or animator than I am, you can create more beautiful movies.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/113610809?color=ff9933" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As a bonus, the new Grease Pencil’s stroke width responds to pressure sensitive drawing tools, like my old Wacom Bamboo tablet.</p>

<p>I’m not a drawer or an animator. But, I have been having fun with this neat little tool, so I thought it fun to share.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_hr.gif" alt="line" /></p>

<h2 id="grease-pencil-set-up">Grease Pencil Set Up</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_screen1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before I start, I make sure to set up Blender for Grease Pencil Animation. You can download my “<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5479646/animation_startup_file.blend">Starter Blend File</a>.” A few things I did here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set both panels to relevant Grease Pencil sections</li>
  <li>Include the Timeline (for play/stop) and Dope Sheet (keyframes).</li>
  <li>Set a white background, making it easy to embed on Medium and emails.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_hr.gif" alt="line" /></p>

<h2 id="step-1-draw">Step 1: Draw</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_screen2.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are five layers I used in my simple printer animation. The printer frame, the build plate, the printed object, the filament, and the nozzle.</p>

<p>To draw hold down “D” on the keyboard and use your mouse or pen to draw. Alternatively, you can also go to the Grease Pencil tab and click “Draw.”</p>

<p>For the build platform and the heart object, I drew the outline and used the fill tool. To fill an outline with color, adjust the “Fill Opacity” value.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_hr.gif" alt="line" /></p>

<h2 id="step-2-add-more-frames">Step 2: Add more frames</h2>

<p>The animation part works like a flipbook. You draw a frame in an animation, and then draw another frame.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_screen3.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In my wee little 3D printer animation, there are only 6 keyframes. Right click or use your keyboard arrow keys to move from one frame to the next in the Dope Sheet (the area with the keyframe). Start drawing to automatically add a new keyframe.</p>

<p>Now, when you start drawing on a new keyframe the old drawing disappears. However, you can turn on the “Onion” skin feature to see a faint shadow of the last keyframe.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_onion.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the build plate, I didn’t need to redraw it, just move it down. To do that, click “Enable Editing” in the left toolbar, then select all the points you want to move, and use key “G” to move the platform down.</p>

<p>Other useful object manipulation short keys are “S” for scale, and “R” for rotation. You can also bind a manipulation to an orientation. In the filament animation, I hit “SX” to squish it horizontally (S for scale, and X for x-axis).</p>

<p>You can scrub through the timeline using the arrow keys, or just hit “Play.”</p>

<p>Last, you’ll want to specify the end frame. To do this, just type in whatever frame number you want as the animation’s end frame. You can also start the animation at an arbitrary frame number too.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_hr.gif" alt="line" /></p>

<h2 id="step-3-export-to-movie-file-or-gif">Step 3: Export to movie file or gif</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/blender_screen4.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>First, specify the File Location where you want to dump your files and file type. You’ll also need to specify a File Type. If you want to make animated gif, export to PNG or JPG. Blender will export each frame separately. You can use Photoshop or GIMP to compile these into an animated gif.</p>

<p>Second, frame your shot. You can hit Shift+B or Spacebar Search for “Zoom to Border” and draw the area to focus on. On my MacBook, I can use the two finger pinch to zoom in an out. I hold down the shift key and use two fingers to pan around. Then on the top menu, I select [Render &gt; OpenGL Image] to get a sense of whether things are in frame or not.</p>

<p>Last, select [Render &gt; Open GL Animation] to animate. And then…</p>

    <p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/carbon3d-1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://carbon3d.com/">Carbon3D</a> unveiled last week at the TED conference. On stage, their demonstration unit that printed a meshy ball structure in about 6 minutes. This print would have taken my home printer maybe 2–3 hours, and an industry printer even longer. Essentially, Carbon3D prints 25–100x faster than current 3D printers. Imagine going to a hardware store with broken desklamp, then getting a replacement part printed in 5 minutes while you grab a cup of coffee or while you wait in the checkout line.</p>

<p>Their TED Video:</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-works">How does it works?</h2>

<p>The printer starts with plastic resin. Let’s just call it the “goo.” This goo solidifies through exposure to UV light. Underneath the vat of goo, a projector projects cross sections of the print with UV light. The light solidifies one layer of the print, and a print bed lifts the solidified layer up a little bit. Now, traditionally once a layer soldifies, that layer sticks to the bottom of the vat containing the goo. The build plate lifts up a little bit to get the bottom layer unstuck. Then, the printer moves onto the next layer.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/carbon3d_process.jpeg" alt="Process Diagram From Carbon3D’s presentation at TED" /></p>

<p>Carbon3D eliminates this one, small step. With Carbon3D, the bottom of the vat is made with a special material that lets oxygen through. The oxygen makes it so the solidified plastic does not stick to the bottom of the vat. This eliminates the need for the build plate to lift up back down every layer, which speeds up printing.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/carbon3d_newprocess.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="the-beauty-of-this-is-that-its-so-simple">The beauty of this is that it’s so simple!</h3>
<p>It’s such a small, change that drastically effects the result. I am just as excited about the increased speed as I am by the elegance of the design improvement.</p>

<h2 id="material-difference">Material difference?</h2>

<p>With this technique, their prints vary in quality — from bouncy rubbery materials to strong plastics used in automotive.</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXIkRsJLXGs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><a href="http://www.unc.edu/spotlight/unc-researchers-collaborate-3d-printing-technology/">University of North Carolina’s press release</a> claims “CLIP enables a very wide range of material to be used to make 3D parts with novel properties, including elastomers, silicones, nylon-like materials, ceramics and biodegradable materials.”</p>

<p><a href="http://carbon3d.com/">Carbon3D’s website</a> claims “We’re able to draw from the whole polymer family to meet highly specific application requirements. Elastomers, for example, cover a range of needs, from the high elasticity needed for athletic shoes to the strength and temperature resistance needed for automotive parts.”</p>

<p>In my experience, the plastics used in this process are fragile and brittle. I printed a 2 inch Pony Statue using a similar technology once (a Form 1 machine, which employs UV light projecting on resin), and both of the back legs broke off. Given these material properties, this technique was really good for prototypes, but you can’t use it to print household components that require strength.</p>

<p>Carbon3D introduces to possibilities to this technology with its expanded range of materials — from flexible footware parts to durable automotive parts. It would be interesting to see how these material stands up to their suggested applications.</p>

<h2 id="team">Team</h2>

<p>The Carbon3D team is hardcore, to put it lightly. The founder, Joseph DeSimone, is a chemist from the University of North Carolina. Others include ex-Tesla, ex-Microsoft, ex-Apple to name a few. Together, the founding team holds patents in the triple digits They are backed with $41 million in funds led by Sequoia (Series A in 2013) and Silver Lake Kraftwerk (Seris B in 2014).</p>

<h2 id="some-things-to-keep-an-eye-on">Some things to keep an eye on</h2>

<p>They have not started shipping printers yet. Though according to Re/code, Carbon3D is “already in testing at a few companies, including an automotive company, an athletic apparel company, a design studio and an academic research lab.”</p>

<p>Second, I wonder about the set up and post printing processes. I don’t have experience with Carbon3D of course, but I have used Form 1 which utilizes a similar technology (UV hits goo and turns it into hard plastic). The plastic from Form 1 machines takes a while to fully cure, even after it is removed from the printer. Goo still sticks to the plastic part, and I need to wash it off. Even so, my model didn’t fully harden until a few days later. Albeit, I did not have a UV lightbath, so I used the sparse winter sun in NYC. Still, if you design a part that requires it to be completely hardened or completely dry, you need to factor in post production effort + time.</p>

<p>I am also interested in their claims on the material. The TED talk focused on print speed, but their website other sources makes some amazing claims on the production-ready material properties. University of North Carolina, where many of their founding team taught, mentions printable nylon plastics and ceramics. The materials are not something they focused on in their press launch, but definitely something to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Last, like all technologies, there are limits. Marketing is great at calling out the benefits, but the limits are usually what I am more interested in. For example, complex parts often require support structures. Even the body and head of my pony structure requires support beams. Support structure adds time, material, and extra manual care in removing the supports. Ultimately, this all leads to increased cost. For prototypers, cost may not be as much of an issue. But, if you were to use this in production, cost is factored into your gross margin and may prevent this technology from penetrating certain low margin, high volume markets like consumer goods (e.g. iPhone cases, toys).</p>

<h2 id="in-the-end-the-product-speaks-for-itself">In the end, the product speaks for itself</h2>

<p>I am amped about this technology. There are so many new 3D Printers and Kickstarters magnifying incremental improvements as revolutionary accomplishments. Or worse, magnifying nothing as revolutionary accomplishments.</p>

<p>But it seems Carbon3D can walk the walk. Having a live demo set up during a talk is risky business, but it let the product speak for itself. In the end, having a good product is the best marketing strategy.</p>
