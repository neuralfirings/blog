title: Life in Low Resolution

It seems like there are more and more designs in low resolution. Maybe I am just pay more attention to low resolution (or low poly) 3D objects because I work in 3D printing.

There is something beautiful in the minimalism of low poly objects. It’s weirdly alien, but organic and natural too.

Maybe people love that real world objects evoke a virtual digital world.

## Exhibit 1. Low Resolution Shoes by United Nude

United Nude is known for artsy, concept shoes. They came out with the [Low Res line](http://www.unitednude.com/lo-res-shoes) a while back, and it looks like these shoes are now a staple in their store. Seems like a validation for people’s love for low resolution objects.

## Exhibit 2. Low Resolution Shoes by Continuum

Continuum Fashion was founded by my friend, Mary Huang. She’s the first person I email when I see something low resolution in life.

These are 3D printed *and* wearable.

## Exhibit 3. Low Resolution Bag by Issey Miyake

This line came out a while back and seems to be a staple at Issey Miyake. This was one of the first objects that I took notice of in low resolution.

## Exhibit 4. Low Resolution Bag by Finell

Super low resolution here, further deconstructing shapes. Then again, I suppose most totes are just two rectangles sandwiching your stuff—that’s low resolution too.

Maybe I should consider going as “Low Resolution” for Halloween.
