title: Ownership to Accessibility

The world is shifting from valuing ownership to valuing accessibility.

I use Rdio to access music. I own very few CDs.

I use Kindle to access books. I trim down my bookshelf every year.

I use Wikipedia to access knowledge. I have a bad memory anyway.

To live in this world, I donâ€™t need more space in my brain. I need more RAM and bandwidth.
