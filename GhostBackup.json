By the way, I have driven daily in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan when I lived in NYC.\n\n**1. This sign is not safe. (this is kindda important)**\n\nIn NYC, different street have different hours when you can or can’t park. You can park here from midnight to 6 AM, there from midnight to 3 AM, and the street next to it? 8 AM to 12 PM. It looks like this sign is designed in a way that stretches the hour marks to accommodate for the individual streets. In the other words, the spacing between hour marks on this sign differ from street to street. This means you can’t just glance at a sign to know whether you can park or not. Because of the small font, you need to carefully drive up close and read the sign.\n\nThis is dangerous!

I’m not convinced this sign solves the problem.**\n\nOne value proposition is the ability to combine multiple signs into one consolidated sign. I suspect, though, that the totem pole of parking signs is symptomatic of the way goverment works — different departments with disjointed processes. Actually, the most annoying signs are the ad-hoc signs.

If my GPS tells me ahead of time of where I can park, that would be idea. I wouldn’t have to scour the streets for signage, then spend time reading the sign when I should be focused on the road.\n\nAlso, often by the time I read the signage I already missed a good chunk of available parking spots. Then I have to loop around the block and see whether there are any parking space alongside the street.\n\nIf Google Maps can help me plan out a “parking finder route,” that would be ideal. I wouldn’t have to even worry about reading signage or plotting routes for how to find parking.\n\n“But what about times when you don’t use Google Maps?”\n\nValid question. The times when I don’t use Google Maps are times when I travel to places I’m already familiar with. In those cases, I’m usually fairly familiar with where I can park at what time, so I wouldn’t need this feature anyway.

In Seattle, some of the speed signs are on interactive displays. The speed limit then can change with the traffic congestion. This is a much more pricey implementation of course. There’s a lot more to manufacture, install, and maintain.\n\nBut, imagine if instead of parking signs, there are interactive displays that plainly tells you “2 hrs until 8 PM” or “No parking until 7 PM.” It ignores all the other rules that may not apply, like showing you what Saturday rules when it’s Thursday.

But, I have been having fun with this neat little tool, so I thought it fun to share.\n\n![line](/content/images/2015/05/blender_hr.gif)\n\n## Grease Pencil Set Up\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/blender_screen1.jpeg)\n\nBefore I start, I make sure to set up Blender for Grease Pencil Animation. You can download my “[Starter Blend File](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5479646/animation_startup_file.blend).” A few things I did here:\n\n1. Set both panels to relevant Grease Pencil sections\n2. Include the Timeline (for play/stop) and Dope Sheet (keyframes).\n3. Set a white background, making it easy to embed on Medium and emails.\n\n![line](/content/images/2015/05/blender_hr.gif)\n\n## Step 1: Draw\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/blender_screen2.jpeg)\n\nThere are five layers I used in my simple printer animation. The printer frame, the build plate, the printed object, the filament, and the nozzle.\n\nTo draw hold down “D” on the keyboard and use your mouse or pen to draw. Alternatively, you can also go to the Grease Pencil tab and click “Draw.”\n\nFor the build platform and the heart object, I drew the outline and used the fill tool. To fill an outline with color, adjust the “Fill Opacity” value.\n\n![line](/content/images/2015/05/blender_hr.gif)\n\n## Step 2: Add more frames\n\nThe animation part works like a flipbook. You draw a frame in an animation, and then draw another frame.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/blender_screen3.jpeg)\n\nIn my wee little 3D printer animation, there are only 6 keyframes. Right click or use your keyboard arrow keys to move from one frame to the next in the Dope Sheet (the area with the keyframe). Start drawing to automatically add a new keyframe.\n\nNow, when you start drawing on a new keyframe the old drawing disappears. However, you can turn on the “Onion” skin feature to see a faint shadow of the last keyframe.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/blender_onion.jpeg)\n\nFor the build plate, I didn’t need to redraw it, just move it down. To do that, click “Enable Editing” in the left toolbar, then select all the points you want to move, and use key “G” to move the platform down.\n\nOther useful object manipulation short keys are “S” for scale, and “R” for rotation. You can also bind a manipulation to an orientation. In the filament animation, I hit “SX” to squish it horizontally (S for scale, and X for x-axis).\n\nYou can scrub through the timeline using the arrow keys, or just hit “Play.”\n\nLast, you’ll want to specify the end frame. To do this, just type in whatever frame number you want as the animation’s end frame. You can also start the animation at an arbitrary frame number too.\n\n![line](/content/images/2015/05/blender_hr.gif)\n\n## Step 3: Export to movie file or gif\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/blender_screen4.jpeg)\n\nFirst, specify the File Location where you want to dump your files and file type. You’ll also need to specify a File Type. If you want to make animated gif, export to PNG or JPG. Blender will export each frame separately. You can use Photoshop or GIMP to compile these into an animated gif.\n\nSecond, frame your shot. You can hit Shift+B or Spacebar Search for “Zoom to Border” and draw the area to focus on. On my MacBook, I can use the two finger pinch to zoom in an out. I hold down the shift key and use two fingers to pan around. Then on the top menu, I select [Render > OpenGL Image] to get a sense of whether things are in frame or not.\n\nLast, select [Render > Open GL Animation] to animate. And then…\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/blender_theend.gif)\n\nP.S.

On stage, their demonstration unit that printed a meshy ball structure in about 6 minutes. This print would have taken my home printer maybe 2–3 hours, and an industry printer even longer. Essentially, Carbon3D prints 25–100x faster than current 3D printers. Imagine going to a hardware store with broken desklamp, then getting a replacement part printed in 5 minutes while you grab a cup of coffee or while you wait in the checkout line.\n\nTheir TED Video:\n\n<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihR9SX7dgRo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## How does it works?\n\nThe printer starts with plastic resin. Let’s just call it the “goo.” This goo solidifies through exposure to UV light. Underneath the vat of goo, a projector projects cross sections of the print with UV light. The light solidifies one layer of the print, and a print bed lifts the solidified layer up a little bit. Now, traditionally once a layer soldifies, that layer sticks to the bottom of the vat containing the goo. The build plate lifts up a little bit to get the bottom layer unstuck. Then, the printer moves onto the next layer.\n\n![Process Diagram From Carbon3D’s presentation at TED](/content/images/2015/05/carbon3d_process.jpeg)\n\nCarbon3D eliminates this one, small step. With Carbon3D, the bottom of the vat is made with a special material that lets oxygen through. The oxygen makes it so the solidified plastic does not stick to the bottom of the vat. This eliminates the need for the build plate to lift up back down every layer, which speeds up printing.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/carbon3d_newprocess.jpeg)\n\n### The beauty of this is that it’s so simple!\nIt’s such a small, change that drastically effects the result. I am just as excited about the increased speed as I am by the elegance of the design improvement.\n\n## Material difference?\n\nWith this technique, their prints vary in quality — from bouncy rubbery materials to strong plastics used in automotive.\n\n<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXIkRsJLXGs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n[University of North Carolina’s press release](http://www.unc.edu/spotlight/unc-researchers-collaborate-3d-printing-technology/) claims “CLIP enables a very wide range of material to be used to make 3D parts with novel properties, including elastomers, silicones, nylon-like materials, ceramics and biodegradable materials.”\n\n[Carbon3D’s website](http://carbon3d.com/) claims “We’re able to draw from the whole polymer family to meet highly specific application requirements. Elastomers, for example, cover a range of needs, from the high elasticity needed for athletic shoes to the strength and temperature resistance needed for automotive parts.”\n\nIn my experience, the plastics used in this process are fragile and brittle. I printed a 2 inch Pony Statue using a similar technology once (a Form 1 machine, which employs UV light projecting on resin), and both of the back legs broke off. Given these material properties, this technique was really good for prototypes, but you can’t use it to print household components that require strength.\n\nCarbon3D introduces to possibilities to this technology with its expanded range of materials — from flexible footware parts to durable automotive parts. It would be interesting to see how these material stands up to their suggested applications.\n\n## Team\n\nThe Carbon3D team is hardcore, to put it lightly. The founder, Joseph DeSimone, is a chemist from the University of North Carolina. Others include ex-Tesla, ex-Microsoft, ex-Apple to name a few. Together, the founding team holds patents in the triple digits They are backed with $41 million in funds led by Sequoia (Series A in 2013) and Silver Lake Kraftwerk (Seris B in 2014).\n\n## Some things to keep an eye on\n\nThey have not started shipping printers yet. Though according to Re/code, Carbon3D is “already in testing at a few companies, including an automotive company, an athletic apparel company, a design studio and an academic research lab.”\n\nSecond, I wonder about the set up and post printing processes. I don’t have experience with Carbon3D of course, but I have used Form 1 which utilizes a similar technology (UV hits goo and turns it into hard plastic). The plastic from Form 1 machines takes a while to fully cure, even after it is removed from the printer. Goo still sticks to the plastic part, and I need to wash it off. Even so, my model didn’t fully harden until a few days later. Albeit, I did not have a UV lightbath, so I used the sparse winter sun in NYC. Still, if you design a part that requires it to be completely hardened or completely dry, you need to factor in post production effort + time.\n\nI am also interested in their claims on the material. The TED talk focused on print speed, but their website other sources makes some amazing claims on the production-ready material properties. University of North Carolina, where many of their founding team taught, mentions printable nylon plastics and ceramics. The materials are not something they focused on in their press launch, but definitely something to keep an eye on.\n\nLast, like all technologies, there are limits. Marketing is great at calling out the benefits, but the limits are usually what I am more interested in. For example, complex parts often require support structures. Even the body and head of my pony structure requires support beams. Support structure adds time, material, and extra manual care in removing the supports. Ultimately, this all leads to increased cost. For prototypers, cost may not be as much of an issue. But, if you were to use this in production, cost is factored into your gross margin and may prevent this technology from penetrating certain low margin, high volume markets like consumer goods (e.g. iPhone cases, toys).\n\n## In the end, the product speaks for itself\n\nI am amped about this technology. There are so many new 3D Printers and Kickstarters magnifying incremental improvements as revolutionary accomplishments. Or worse, magnifying nothing as revolutionary accomplishments.\n\nBut it seems Carbon3D can walk the walk. Having a live demo set up during a talk is risky business, but it let the product speak for itself. In the end, having a good product is the best marketing strategy.\n\n---\n\n<small>Thanks to [Mary Huang](https://twitter.com/rhyme_andreason) and [James Zhou](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~qnzhou/) for feedback on this post and helping me understand exactly how Carbon3D works.</small","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/05/carbon3d-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://carbon3d.com/\">Carbon3D</a> unveiled last week at the TED conference.

Blender is a free and open source tool for animators and game designers. You can make some very impressive 3D artwork with Blender. Some people even use it for 2D animation. While it is good for modeling and sculpting organic shapes, you have to take many twists and turns and make it work for precision modeling, tools commonly found in CAD software.\n\nTake a very basic CAD feature: specifying the length of an edge. In Blender, you have to either use the ruler or edge length tool to measure the edge. Then you do a little division of the target length divided by current length. Then you scale it by the result of that division. Now, I’ve gotten used to this schlep, but come on, it’s no good.\n\nI’ve been noodling around with the idea of writing an Add On for some basic CAD features. I’ve poked around at Blender user groups and forums, just to see if there are interest in such a tool.\n\nI foud, though, that besides a few crazies like me, most Blender users do not need to be super precise. They are modeling animation characters and art, not household component parts that require specific measurements. Because Blender does not have these tools, they tend to not attract these types of modelers. So if I look to current Blender users to validate the need for such an add on, I am perhaps not looking in the right place.\n\nI wonder how often companies and product designers face this issue. They come up with some idea, validate it with their current user base, and end up with the wrong conclusions because they talked to the wrong people. Maybe their product is to solve a problem with non-users and they only talked to current users.\n\nI see variations of this problem at previous companies I’ve worked at, where it’s easier to talk to long time users because they are always accessible and ready to share feedback. But sometimes, product designers need to help new users, not experienced users. And new users face very different problems. We end up improving niche features for a small (but powerful) segment of our community, and miss the big opportunities because we are not talking to new users or non-users. After all, there are a lot more new users than existing users, and there are a lot more non-users than new users. This isn’t to say existing users and power users are not important, but that sometimes we miss other pieces of the pie, or miss opportunities for making a bigger pie. And we all love pie.\n\nPS.

While it is good for modeling and sculpting organic shapes, you have to take many twists and turns and make it work for precision modeling, tools commonly found in CAD software.</p>\n\n<p>Take a very basic CAD feature: specifying the length of an edge. In Blender, you have to either use the ruler or edge length tool to measure the edge. Then you do a little division of the target length divided by current length. Then you scale it by the result of that division. Now, I’ve gotten used to this schlep, but come on, it’s no good.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been noodling around with the idea of writing an Add On for some basic CAD features. I’ve poked around at Blender user groups and forums, just to see if there are interest in such a tool.</p>\n\n<p>I foud, though, that besides a few crazies like me, most Blender users do not need to be super precise. They are modeling animation characters and art, not household component parts that require specific measurements. Because Blender does not have these tools, they tend to not attract these types of modelers. So if I look to current Blender users to validate the need for such an add on, I am perhaps not looking in the right place.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how often companies and product designers face this issue. They come up with some idea, validate it with their current user base, and end up with the wrong conclusions because they talked to the wrong people. Maybe their product is to solve a problem with non-users and they only talked to current users.</p>\n\n<p>I see variations of this problem at previous companies I’ve worked at, where it’s easier to talk to long time users because they are always accessible and ready to share feedback. But sometimes, product designers need to help new users, not experienced users. And new users face very different problems. We end up improving niche features for a small (but powerful) segment of our community, and miss the big opportunities because we are not talking to new users or non-users. After all, there are a lot more new users than existing users, and there are a lot more non-users than new users. This isn’t to say existing users and power users are not important, but that sometimes we miss other pieces of the pie, or miss opportunities for making a bigger pie. And we all love pie.</p>\n\n<p>PS.

I use it in my spare time to design 3d printed household parts. I use it at work when working with more organic designs and jewelry products for [MixeeLabs](http://www.mixeelabs.com). If you just want to simply extrude a logo or image, there are [other tools](http://www.mixeelabs.com/mixeepopper). But if you want to model more complex shapes, I recommend checking out [Blender](http://www.blender.org).\n\nBlender may seem like an odd choice because it isn’t really built around product design or 3d printing. Its main use case is for 3d animation. However, I’ve used many different packages, and I always go back to Blender.\n\nNow, I am not a professional 3d modeler. I’ve worked with 3d printing since 2010, and learned a lot about 3d modeling as a result. Blender has often been criticized as not being easy to learn, but based on my own experience starting from scratch, I think it’s actually a very manageable modeling package.\n\n## Blender is free and works across platforms\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/whyblender_1.png)\n\nPeople with different budgets and different operating systems often ask me to recommend modeling software. I want to recommend something that will work with their operating system, and operates in their price range.\n\nThis flexibility and cross compatibility also makes it easy for me to work with different designers, because Blender is able to import and export basically all the different file types. We developed the [Mixee Labs plugin for Blender](http://www.mixeelabs.com/morph) because it doesn’t require designers to switch operating systems to run our software, or shell out thousands of dollars for new modeling software.\n\nLast, it is one of the few modeling programs that work (well) on Macs. Some of the most popular packages (e.g. SolidWorks) are only available for Windows. Others provide only buggy versions for Macs. Blender works just as well on my Mac as it did on my old Windows machine—I can’t say the same about Excel.\n\n## Spacebar Search\n\nBlender is chock-full of features, which are powerful but can be overwhelming for beginners. This is a common criticism for why Blender is not beginner friendly. The Spacebar Search is an elegant way to make features more accessible without reducing the feature set for advanced users.\n\nYou press the spacebar and search for features by name. This is perfect for when I can’t remember the hotkeys or what feature is on which toolbar. As a bonus, through using the Spacebar Search, I learned the hotkeys for my most commonly used features. It ended up as a nice educational tool as well.\n\n## I use it for precision modeling, organic models, texture mapping, and sculpting\n\n![](/content/images/2015/05/whyblender_2.jpeg)\n\nOne of my favorite things about working with Blender is that I can use the software regardless of what type of modeling I need. Many packages focus on certain type of modeling—architects and jewelry designers would use very different modeling software. Blender certainly has its focuses (3d animation), but I’ve found it adaptable to all my modeling needs.\n\nBlender’s strength is in artistic/organic modeling—characters, figurines, sculptures. So, it has great mesh modeling and texture mapping tools. Many CAD packages don’t have great tools for adding textures for color 3d printing. In addition to mesh modeling, Blender also has a sculpting engine for those who modify models as one would do with clay.\n\nAs for precise mechanical parts, this is Blender’s weakest area, but it is good enough for me. I can measure distance and wall thickness. I can resize parts to specific measurements (albeit sometimes there’s a little addition and subtraction involved). For me, the bottleneck is more on 3d printers’ ability to print with accuracy than in the model file’s accuracy.\n\n## (Rudimentary) 3D Printing Tools\n\nWhen modeling, there’s the Ruler/Protractor Tool to help you measure wall thickness. This is important when you are optimizing for both cost, time, and structural strength.\n\nThere’s also a 3d Printing Toolbox—an addon that calculates volume, surface area, and overhangs. This is necessary for estimating cost and print-time.\n\nThat said, my Blender files often need little fixes before sending them to the printer. However, there are programs like MeshLab and NetFabb that help fix your files. Also, if you use a service like Shapeways, they will fix your files automatically before it goes to print.\n\n## Active community, fast development\n\n![Blender Conference 2012. Image courtesy of BlenderNation](/content/images/2015/05/whyblender_3-1.jpeg)\n\nBlender has an amazing and active community. This means there are lots of people to help troubleshoot, write tutorials, and develop new features. This is one of the first things I look for. In lieu of corporate support hotlines and dedicated support teams, strong communities help you navigate the ins and outs.\n\nThis doesn’t just apply to features—the UI is improving as well. Blender gets a lot of slack for having a bad UI. Blender 2.5 (IMO) greatly improved on the UI, and now there’s even a dedicated team to further refine the UI.\n\n## Nothing is perfect, Blender is no exception\n\nOf course, I always want more.\n\nI would love better tools for parametric modeling. I would also love integration with fast slicers and OctoPrint.\n\nI would love to aggregate all the tools I most commonly use into one toolbar (with nice icons) and then hide the other parts of the UI I don’t use. Yes, I know you can do this with Python scripting… but… Python scripting.\n\nCurrently, it is the best package out there for my needs.

In a short time, there’s been many spin offs and variations of the game. It has become some sort of “a thing” in the dev community. It even has its own XKCD—that’s when you know it’s made it big. This is why I think it has gained so much traction.\n\n## 1. Fine line between thinking and button mashing\n\n2048 is an addicting game because it occupies this powerful and difficult to find space. It’s brainless enough to where you can play for hours on end without putting in much effort, but not brainless enough to where it’s boring. You use your brain just enough to feel like you are working hard at something, but you aren’t actually working hard so it’s all good.\n\n## 2. Little achievements, one at a time. Sometimes.\n\nWhen you play 2048, you can sense that you are making progress towards the goal. Numbers combine to make higher numbers, maybe there’s even some fun sound effect (I don’t know, I mute all my games). The achievements come often, but at random time intervals. You may get a small combo pretty often, but the big combos are more sporadic. Random level ups keep us going. It’s the same theory they use in slot machines (you win a little often, but you win at random).\n\n## 3. Open source >> developer meme\n\nThe developer made this open source, so other developers are riffing. Some developer made a version in sed, an AI version, and of course the Doctor Who version. It’s a meme based on meatier derivatives. It’s not just slapping some funny text onto a picture (well, with the exception of the Doctor Who version).\n\n## 4. HTML5/Javascript as Game Engines\n\nYou don’t have to muck through Game Libraries and C++ to tweak and modify this code. You just need to to know HTML and Javascript. And guess what, shittons of people in today’s world know HTML and Javascript! It is one of the foundation of modern web design.\n\n## 5. Building off of shoulders of giants\n\nSurprise, surprise. This game is not original. It is based on 1024 which is based on Threes. And that’s perfectly ok. You can recreate something that’s better in some way, but not original in all the ways. The gameplay isn’t original, but 2048 had a more modern “webby” looking design than the previous versions, it’s open sourced and hack-friend, and it uses a web-friendly platform. That said, the tweaks to the gameplay were pretty spot-on. When compared with its predecessor, 2048 brought more button-mashing into the mix and nudged it closer to the sweet spot.\n\nSo, what else can we rebuild, tweak? People don’t change—they like the same mechanics, but design aesthetics and technology changes. I wonder what else has great mechanics, but needs a more modern facelift. I wonder what games lend themselves to being tweaked, with a platform more tweakable—perhaps—than HTML/JavaScript.","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/05/2048.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Yes… that is my phone. 2048!</p>\n\n<p>Over the past few weeks, a game called 2048 has hit the scene.

I think that is driving the explosion in new blogging sites focused on writing. Whitespaces, no distraction, markdown… anything to make it easy to write meaningful content.

I don’t consider myself that old, but I guess I am old enough to observe a cycle in the way we produce online content.</p>\n\n<p>When I was in high school, blogs like LiveJournal and Xanga were the way my friends and I produced online content. People posted about their lives, read each other’s blogs, commented. I even met some of my future classmates through our college’s pre-frosh LiveJournal community.</p>\n\n<p>Then sometime during college, that all stopped. Rather than creating original content, we substituted in quick actions. We liked on Facebook, retweeted on Twitter, and reblogged on Tumblr. There was this one button content “creation” phenomena.</p>\n\n<p>We are swinging back. People have gotten tired of the quickie content creation. They yearn for meatier content. I think that is driving the explosion in new blogging sites focused on writing. Whitespaces, no distraction, markdown… anything to make it easy to write meaningful content. I am looking at Ghost, Svbtle, and of course, Medium.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps to invent the next step is to look back. Revamp some of those crazy ideas of 1990s like web rings and LiveJournal communities, but with a Web 2.0 spin—minimalism, flat design, maybe something with Node.js or Firebase or whatever is the hip new thing on Hacker News.</p>\n\n<p>After all, some of those PowerPoint animations that we made fun of are revamping into jQuery $.fadeIn(). iPhone apps now zoom in and out just like my high school PowerPoints once did.

I like it because you start with a visual representation of the breadboard, Raspberry PI, and whatever components.

I spent a little while Googling around for cheap PCB prototypers (low volume, relatively quick turnaround). I ended up using [ITEAD](http://imall.iteadstudio.com/) in Shenzhen. For a PCB of this size (1.5x1.75 inches), they will produce 10 QTY for $10. Not a bad deal. \n\nFor a more detailed write up of how I made Custom PCBs, check out [this blog post](http://blog.nyl.io/making-custom-pcbs/).

The old version had to connect to a laptop, and the treat container was a plastic cup held together by scotch tape and paperclips. It also didn’t come with a nanny cam so we had to use Ustream, which while free, had ads and a 30 sec delay. And thus Treaty v2 was born.\n\nI cobbled together this device, which streams video and audio in almost-real time (the audio has a 10 sec delay).

For streaming video and audio, I also used the [RaspBaby](https://github.com/moustaki/raspbaby) setup, which installs mjpg-streamer for video and darkice running on icecast for audio.

This part of [a project](http://blog.nyl.io/dog-treat-dispenser-v3/) is where I control a stepper motor, which tells the dispenser to twist the fan looking thing and dispense a treat. Luckily, Adafruit has published [this exact tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-10-stepper-motors/overview). So I followed the Adafruit tutorial and plugged in a whole bunch of wires where the tutorial told me to plug. Easy enough! But now, how does one tidy things up? \n\nWhy, **printed circuit boards**, of course! You know, those green things with lines all over them. Don't worry. It's not that hard. \n\n## Meet Fritzing, your friendly PCB designer\n\n[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/) is kind of like LEGOs of PCB design. It's simple, good for learning. A stepping stone to Eagle or KiCAD. \n\n### Step 1: Virtual Breadboard\n\nThis is my favorite part of Fritzing. As a novice hardware hacker, it helps that I start with something I already have working: breadboards and jumper wires. \n\n![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/06/fritzing_breadboard-1.png)\n\nWith Fritzing, you start with a virtual breadboard set up. Click the \"Breadboard\" tab. Here, you can search for various components, like \"breadboard\" and \"Raspberry Pi\" and \"L293D\" (the motor driver I used). \n\nAdd components to the workspace. Then click to start dragging wires around. Protip: press the control (Windows) or cmd (Mac) key to make the wires all bendy... just like in real life. \n\n### Step 2: Schematics\n\nIf you switch to the Schematics tab, you'll see an outline of the schematics. But... I didn't really deal with this view very much. So let's skip it. =P\n\n### Step 3: PCB\n\nNow we get to the fun part! When you open up the PCB view, you should see something like this. \n\n![](/content/images/2015/06/fritzing_pcb-1.png)\n\nThis is just the components you selected. Well, they are holes to plug in the components you selected. \n\nThe dotted lines represent where the connections should go. Our goal is to turn these dotted line (airwires) into routes. To do this, just drag a dotted line into place. \n\n![](/content/images/2015/06/Pasted_Image_6_25_15__1_15_AM.png)\n\nThe goal is to create a board without any routes criss crossing with another route. That would be bad. Electricity would ram into one another and we will not have a good time. \n\nOne way to tackle this is to use multiple layers. For me, 2 layers was sufficient to route all the airwires without anything crossing. \n\nTo connect a route on the top layer with one on the bottom layer, you use via. As in, go from top to bottom via this connection. To do this add a bend point by right clicking on route then clicking \"Add a Bendpoint.\" Then, right click on the bend point and choose \"Convert Bendpoint to Via.\" Then you can right click on different parts of the route to move between layers. \n\n![](/content/images/2015/06/Pasted_Image_6_25_15__1_19_AM.png)\n\nEventually, all your routes come together nice and cleanly. You can check that your routes are indeed error free by using the nifty design checker (Tool Bar > Route > Design Rule Check). \n\nI ended up with something like this. \n\n![](/content/images/2015/06/Pasted_Image_6_25_15__1_25_AM-1.png)\n\nThe dots on top is just a marking I made to tell me which pins I need to solder. Or more importantly, which pins I can use as practice. My soldering skills are... lacking. \n\nYou can add text (like the dots or the \"badwolf v3\" in the bottom left) by searching for \"silkscreen\" under the Parts section in the right toolbar. \n\n## Production\n\nNow that we have a PCB sketch, let's get to making. \n\nWhat I ended up doing is exporting to Gerber files. It's a series of files that tells the machine where to drill holes, how to label things, and of course where to put down the copper so your precious electricity can flow to their rightful homes.\n\nYou can preview your Gerber files to make sure they work using [GerbLook](http://www.gerblook.org).\n\n### PCB Prototyping Companies\n\nI did a few searches, and found some good options. This is based on:\n\n* shipping to Seattle \n* 2 layer board \n* board that measures 1.5x1.75 in<sup>2</sup>. \n\nActual mileage may vary depending on your design. \n\n<table style=\"font-size: 0.75em\">\n<tr style=\"font-weight: bold\"><td>Company</td><td>QTY</td><td>Lead Time (to Seattle)</td><td>Price</td><td>Limits/Pricing</td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://oshpark.com\">OSHPark</a></td><td>3</td><td>10-14 business days<br />8-12 production + 2 shipping</td><td>$12<br />$12 PCB + $0 shipping</td><td>$5/in<sup>2</sup></td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://pcbnet.com\">PCBNet</a></td><td>1</td><td>9 BDs<br />5 prod + 4 shipping</td><td>$25<br />$25 PCB + $0 shipping</td><td>under 60in<sup>2</sup></td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://imall.iteadstudio.com\">ITEAD</a></td><td>10</td><td>6 BDs<br />4 prod + 2 shipping</td><td>$28<br />$10 PCB + $18 shipping</td><td>under 5x5cm<sup>2</sup></td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://imall.iteadstudio.com\">ITEAD</a></td><td>10</td><td>20 BDs (could be longer)<br />4 prod + 16-? shipping</td><td>$15<br />$10 PCB + $5 shipping</td><td>under 5x5cm<sup>2</sup></td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://seeedstudio.com\">SeeedStudio</a></td><td>1</td><td>18-48 BDs<br />3 prod + 15-45 shipping</td><td>$15<br />$10 PCB + $5 shipping</td><td>under 5x5cm<sup>2</sup</td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://seeedstudio.com\">SeeedStudio</a></td><td>1</td><td>5 BDs<br />3 production + 2 shipping</td><td>$40<br />$10 PCB + $30 shipping</td><td>under 5x5cm<sup>2</sup></td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href=\"http://fr.com\">Fritzing</a></td><td>1</td><td>17-25 BDs<br />7-11 production + 10-14 shipping</td><td>$21<br />$17 PCB + $4 shipping</td><td>$5.20 + $0.96/cm<sup>2</sup></td></tr>\n</table>\n\nIn the US, the fastest/cheapest seem to be OSHPark if you have small boards. OSHPark (stands for open source hardware park) charges by the square inch. So if you have a tinyass board like my dog treat thing, it's only $12 or less. If you have a 3x3in<sup>2</sup> board though, it's $45, even though each side only doubled in length. Yay. Behold the power of exponents. \n\nI ordered from ITEAD. Paid a little extra for DHL Express. Still, it came down to about $3/PCB since they ship 10 QTY. I did end up having to use an extra PCB because I'm apparently the kind of idiot who solders things backwards the first time around. \n\n![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/06/01_boards.jpg)\n\nNot bad, eh? \n\nOk.

I will continue to document my progress on this blog. First, I just want a place to dump all my notes. That way, if (when) shit start burning, I can at least replicate what I know to work. Second, other people might find it useful and if I can help you avoid some of the headaches I went through, then all the better. \n\n---\n\n## The Hardware\n### ESP8266\nAh, the [ESP8266, the $2 Wifi Module](http://www.ebay.com/itm/151657399118)[^n]. For the impatient, it's also [available on Amazon Prime for $8](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O34AGSU) with Prime Free Same Day Delivery[^n]. \n\nIsn't it just the most adorable thing? ![](/content/images/2015/07/IMG_5414.JPG)\n\n### FTDI Cable\nTo connect to my laptop, I used Adafruit's [USB FTDI Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/products/70). ![](/content/images/2015/07/IMG_5415.JPG)\n\n### Jumper Wires & Breadboard\nYou can use [female-to-male jumper wires](http://www.amazon.com/Jumper-Wires-Premium-200mm-Female/dp/B008MRZSH8) and [male-to-male jumper wires](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ARTWJ44) to connect the pins on the ESP to the FTDI Cable. You might also need a [breadboard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GYAIES/) since two wires sometime go to one input. \n\n---\n\n## The Software: NodeMCU\n[NodeMCU](http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html) lets you use LUA scripting language to program the ESP8266. Apparently, there are some issues with memory going this route. I found it to be pretty straightforward. \n\nIf you are comfortable with Arduino, there is an Arduino library. I'll cover how to use ArduinoIDE in a different post.\n\nHere's what I did to get it working[^n]:\n\n### 1. Hooked up ESP8266 in NodeMCU Flasher Mode\n<table style=\"font-size: 0.8em\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background: #fff\"><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/esp8266_dia.jpg\" style=\"max-height:120px; margin: 0\"/></td>\n<td colspan=2 style=\"background: #fff\"><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/ftdi_dia-1.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 120px; margin: 0\"/></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><th>ESP8266</th><th>FTDI</th><th>Why?</th></tr>\n<tr><td>VCC</td><td>VCC</td><td>POWER!</td></tr>\n<tr><td>GND</td><td>GND</td><td>POWER!</td></tr>\n<tr><td>TX</td><td>RX</td><td>Send info from esp to computer</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RX</td><td>TX</td><td>Send info from computer to esp</td></tr>\n<tr><td>GPIO0</td><td>GND</td><td>Ground to start update</td></tr>\n<tr><td>GPIO2</td><td>None</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Reset</td><td>None</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>CH_PD</td><td>VCC</td><td>Enables the chip</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### 2. Flash NodeMCU Firmware\nMac/Linux Command Line can use Esptool (see below). Windows machines can use [NodeMCU-Flasher](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher).\n\n#### Get Port Name\nI ran this command to get the port name for my USB. The USB has to be plugged in and hooked up for this to show. \n\n```\nls /dev/tty.*\n```\n\nOn a Mac, you should get something like `/dev/tty.usbserial-ABC`. \n\nFor Windows, you can use your Device Manager and look under \"Ports (COM and LPT)\". The Port Name should be `COM3` or something like that. You might have to install FTDI Driver first.\n\n#### esptool\n\n[Esptool](https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool) is a Python script that lets you flash the ESP8266 module. \n\nDownload latest [NodeMCU Firmware](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/tree/master/pre_build/latest) (a file name \"nodemcu_latest.bin\") into some folder. Then, install Esptool, I used git clone to do this. You can also just download the python file, [esptool.py](https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool/raw/master/esptool.py). \n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool.git\ncd esptool\npython esptool.py --port <YOUR_PORT_NAME> write_flash 0x00000 <PATH_TO_FIRMWARE>\n```\n\nFor example, say your port name is `/dev/tty.usbserial-ABC` and you downloaded the `nodemcu_latest.bin` to `/Users/me/nodemcu/nodemcu_latest.bin`, you'd write:\n\n```\npython esptool.py --port /dev/tty.usbserial-ABC write_flash 0x00000 /Users/me/nodemcu/nodemcu_latest.bin\n```\n\n### 3. Hooked up ESP8266 in NodeMCU Coding Mode\nThe coding mode is similar to Flash Mode, but without GPIO0 connected to ground.\n<table style=\"font-size: 0.8em\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background: #fff\"><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/esp8266_dia.jpg\" style=\"max-height:120px; margin: 0\"/></td>\n<td colspan=2 style=\"background: #fff\"><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/ftdi_dia-1.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 120px; margin: 0\"/></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><th>ESP8266</th><th>FTDI</th><th>Why?</th></tr>\n<tr><td>VCC</td><td>VCC</td><td>POWER!</td></tr>\n<tr><td>GND</td><td>GND</td><td>POWER!</td></tr>\n<tr><td>TX</td><td>RX</td><td>Send info from esp to computer</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RX</td><td>TX</td><td>Send info from computer to esp</td></tr>\n<tr><td>GPIO0</td><td>None</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>GPIO2</td><td>None</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Reset</td><td>None</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>CH_PD</td><td>VCC</td><td>Enables the chip</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n### 4. Connect via Serial Terminal\n\nFor Mac/Linux, use the screen command line tool. Mac Users can also use [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/). Windows users can use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). Other options are covered in [Sparkfun's Terminal Basics Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/all). This guide starts with detailed explanation and what this \"terminal\" thing is and a little history as well. A good read for the curious.\n\nFor NodeMCU, use `baud rate=9600`. I'm not sure if you have to, but all the tutorials I've read online says to use 9600. So sure, why not. 9600.\n\n#### Screen Command\n\n[Screen](https://kb.iu.edu/d/acuy) allows you to use multiple windows (virtual VT100 terminals) in Mac and Linux machines. You can call it using the command line:\n\n```\nscreen <PORT_NAME> <BAUD_RATE>\n```\nSay, you get `/dev/tty.usbserial-ABC` as your USB port name and want to connect using `9600` baud rate. You would type in:\n```\nscreen /dev/tty.usbserial-ABC 9600\n```\nTo exit screen, `CTRL+A` theb `CTRL+\\`one after the other. \n\n#### CoolTerm\nYou can also use [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/) if you want a GUI tool. Open up CoolTerm, then click Options. Set the Baud Rate to 9600 and select the Port. You might have to click \"Re-scan Serial Ports.\" \n\nThen under \"Terminal\" (option on the left side), check \"Handle BS and DEL Character.\" This will enable you to use the backspace or delete key[^n].\n\nThen click \"OK\" and click \"Connect.\"\n\n### 5. Start Coding!\n\nYou can try a simple hello world to see if it works. \n\n```\nprint(\"hello world\")\n```\n\nThis should return... well, hello world.\n\nTry fiddling around with some of the [NodeMCU Examples](http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html#fr_5475f7667976d8501100000f). A complete list of functions you can call is [documented here](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/wiki/nodemcu_api_en).\n\n#### init.lua\n`init.lua` is the file your ESP8266 will run at boot. Just.. don't put an infinite loop into this file like I did the first time. If you do, you'll have to reflash your module.\n\nNow, using a Serial Terminal you can type (or copy/paste) one line at a time. This might make your head explode. In comes luatool to save the day.\n\n#### luatool\n[Luatool](https://github.com/4refr0nt/luatool) is a Python script that enables you to edit Lua using whatever text editor you wish, and then send the file to the ESP8266 module. \n\nI used Git Clone to install. But you can download the [luatool.py file](https://github.com/4refr0nt/luatool/raw/master/luatool/luatool.py) instead.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/4refr0nt/luatool.git\ncd luatool/luatool\n```\nThen you can upload a lua file in the currently directory using: \n```bash\npython luatool.py --port <YOUR_PORT_NAME> --src <YOUR_FILE.lua>\n```\nFor example, if you get `/dev/tty.usbserial-ABC` as your USB port name and want to upload `foo.lua`. You would type in:\n```\npython luatool.py --port /dev/tty.usbserial-ABC --src foo.lua\n```\n\nNOTE: you need to disconnect from all other connections to the ESP8266. So if you're using CoolTerm, click \"Disconnect\" at the top. If you're using `screen`, do `Ctrl+a` then `Ctrl+\\` to disconnect.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI've found this to be pretty nifty. Looking through the NodeMCU example, you can set up a simple web server, though the memory limits of Lua leaves much to be desired. \n\nAlso, we tried on our local network and logging in takes a while. I'm not quite sure how networks work, but I'm sure that I experienced slowness. And I'm sure that I don't like slowness. \n\n### 1. Better way to parse HTTP Responses\n\nThe ESP8266 can also act as a client. It can read webpages and execute certain commands. I will need to write something to parse all the header junk out and return a JSON or something simple. Right now when I send a request, I get this monster:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx\nDate: Sun, 05 Jul 2015 01:56:57 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: keep-alive\nStatus: 200 OK\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nX-UA-Compatible: chrome=1\nETag: \"9bb58f26192e4ba00f01e2e7b136bbd8\"\nCache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate\nX-Request-Id: 8f9baf99-1418-4558-90ff-de1e2b55988a\nX-Runtime: 0.016318\nVary: Origin\n\nd\n{\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n0\n```\n\nAll I really want is `{\"foo\": \"bar\"}` here. \n\n### 2. Better way to load up \"large\" lua scripts\n\nI also need a way to write larger Lua scripts. `luatool` is ~~a bit~~ a lot shaky with larger files (>40 lines). Maybe I'll write a function that appends to a file rather than write a new file. \n\nThen again, maybe this is why people use ArduinoIDE to program the ESP8266 rather than NodeMCU. More on that later. \n\n🍻 Oh well, time to drink beer. Happy 4th of July, everyone! 🇺🇸\n\n\n<!-- FOOTNOTES -->\n\n[^n]: I have two modules coming from this eBay seller coming.

Looking through the NodeMCU example, you can set up a simple web server, though the memory limits of Lua leaves much to be desired. </p>\n\n<p>Also, we tried on our local network and logging in takes a while. I'm not quite sure how networks work, but I'm sure that I experienced slowness. And I'm sure that I don't like slowness. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1betterwaytoparsehttpresponses\">1. Better way to parse HTTP Responses</h3>\n\n<p>The ESP8266 can also act as a client. It can read webpages and execute certain commands. I will need to write something to parse all the header junk out and return a JSON or something simple. Right now when I send a request, I get this monster:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nServer: nginx  \nDate: Sun, 05 Jul 2015 01:56:57 GMT  \nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8  \nTransfer-Encoding: chunked  \nConnection: keep-alive  \nStatus: 200 OK  \nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  \nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block  \nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  \nX-UA-Compatible: chrome=1  \nETag: \"9bb58f26192e4ba00f01e2e7b136bbd8\"  \nCache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate  \nX-Request-Id: 8f9baf99-1418-4558-90ff-de1e2b55988a  \nX-Runtime: 0.016318  \nVary: Origin\n\nd  \n{\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n0  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>All I really want is <code>{\"foo\": \"bar\"}</code> here. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2betterwaytoloaduplargeluascripts\">2. Better way to load up \"large\" lua scripts</h3>\n\n<p>I also need a way to write larger Lua scripts. <code>luatool</code> is <del>a bit</del> a lot shaky with larger files (>40 lines). Maybe I'll write a function that appends to a file rather than write a new file. </p>\n\n<p>Then again, maybe this is why people use ArduinoIDE to program the ESP8266 rather than NodeMCU. More on that later. </p>\n\n<p>🍻 Oh well, time to drink beer.

I ran into a few problems:\n\n* Uploading big files were prone to error, and it took multiple tries\n* Memory! I seemed to not have much\n* The callbacks were driving me insane. I decided to not like callback functions for the time being. \n\nIn comes Arduino to save the day. There are a lot of useful libraries written for Arduino--libraries for stepper motors and parsing JSON for example. Also, the stepper motors are controlled by Arduino's microcontroller in the end, so it is just simpler to have one language write for both the Wifi Module (ESP) and the microcontroller (Arduino). Last, no upload errors (that weren't my fault).\n\nThe first thing I did was blink an LED, because that's simply the first thing you do when you get hardware.\n\n<iframe class=\"imgur-embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GfD93zj.gifv#embed\"></iframe>\n\nOn the client side (the page on my phone), the \"Light On\" button sends a \"On\" value to the `light.json` file. The ESP8266 connects to my home Wifi and reads the `light.json` file. If it sees an \"On\" value, it lights up. \n\n![](/content/images/2015/07/esp_led_dataflow.png)\n\nIf you want to poke around the code, all the code/schematics I describe in this blog post can be found on this project's [GitHub Page](https://github.com/neuralfirings/esp8266led). \n\n## Parts One: Get Yo Stuff\n\nThis project requires the following ingredients:\n\n1. [ESP8266-01](http://amzn.to/1Lu6QHu): Module to connect to the Wifis\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O34AGSU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00O34AGSU&linkCode=as2&tag=nylio-20&linkId=QSFWU7POV4SORVP7\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00O34AGSU&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=nylio-20\" ></a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=nylio-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00O34AGSU\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\n2. [White LED](http://www.amazon.com/10PCS-10mm-Ultra-Bright-White/dp/B00BWKMOWY/): with forward 3.3V (lower level LEDs tend to confuse the ESP, I'm sure you can use resistors and other magical components to fix this but I didn't look into it much)\n![](/content/images/2015/07/whiteled.jpg)\n\n3. [FTDI Cable](http://www.amazon.com/SparkFun-FTDI-Cable-5V-VCC-3-3V/dp/B00DJBPIGI/): You can also use other FTDI tools like FTDI friend\n![](/content/images/2015/07/ftdiusb.jpg)\n\n4. [Battery](http://www.amazon.com/Teenitor-650mAh-Battery-Charger-Parts/dp/B00NQV0Z46/): I used a Lipo (Lithium Ion Polymer) battery because it's small and rechargeable. I actually used [Adafruit's Battery](https://www.adafruit.com/product/258) in the video above, but the one I link to on Amazon should work as well (and it comes with a charger). \n\n![](/content/images/2015/07/esp_battery.jpg)\n\n5. You also need essentials like [Breadboard](http://www.amazon.com/Solderless-BreadBoard-tie-points-power-rails/dp/B005GYAIES/) and [Jumper Wires](http://www.amazon.com/2-54mm-Breadboard-Male-male-female-female-female-male/dp/B00E8Z3528/). \n\nOne note. Hehe. I didn't use regulators for this project. The LiPo Battery I'm using is 3.7V and the ESP8266 take 3.3V, so I guess it's not THAT bad. But you should use regulators! At least that's what my friends who electronics tell me. You can find some nice [3.3V Regulators on Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2165).\n\n## Part Two: JSON & PHP[^n]\n\n### light.json\nThe `light.json` file is simple. It either reads `{\"light\":\"on\"}` or `{\"light\":\"off\"}`. That's it. Keep in mind though, it needs to be set to permission 777 so the PHP file can write to it (though 666 works too).\n\n### index.php\nThe `index.php` file is the public file that writes `{\"light\":\"on\"}` or `{\"light\":\"off\"}` to `light.json`. Here is the barebones code. There are two links that links you to the current page with a url parameter `?light=on` or `?light=off`. Based on the url parameter, the PHP writes the appropriate instructions to the JSON file. \n\n```\n<?php\n$light = $_GET['light'];\nif($light == \"on\") {\n  $file = fopen(\"light.json\", \"w\") or die(\"can't open file\");\n  fwrite($file, '{\"light\": \"on\"}');\n  fclose($file);\n} \nelse if ($light == \"off\") {\n  $file = fopen(\"light.json\", \"w\") or die(\"can't open file\");\n  fwrite($file, '{\"light\": \"off\"}');\n  fclose($file);\n}\n?>\n\n<a href=\"?light=on\">Turn On</a>\n<a href=\"?light=off\">Turn Off</a>\n<div>\n  <?php\n    if($light==\"on\") {\n      echo(\"Turn LED on.\");\n    }\n    else if ($light==\"off\") {\n      echo(\"Turn LED off.\");\n    }\n    else {\n      echo (\"Do something.\");\n    }\n  ?>\n</div>\n```\n\nI merged this code into my handy [template.html](http://www.nyl.io/template.html) HTML page to start. This page is preloaded with jQuery, Bootstrap (with simple layout preloaded), and Font Awesome. I don't use jQuery or Font Awesome on this particular project. Then I added some styling classes (e.g. `btn-large` and styling divs to make things response, pretty, and all that good stuff).\n\nHere's the final code for `index.php`:\n\n```\n<?php\n$light = $_GET['light'];\nif($light == \"on\") {\n  $file = fopen(\"light.json\", \"w\") or die(\"can't open file\");\n  fwrite($file, '{\"light\": \"on\"}');\n  fclose($file);\n} \nelse if ($light == \"off\") {\n  $file = fopen(\"light.json\", \"w\") or die(\"can't open file\");\n  fwrite($file, '{\"light\": \"off\"}');\n  fclose($file);\n}\n?>\n\n<html>\n  <head>      \n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n    \n    <title>LED for ESP8266</title>\n   \n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\n    <link href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css\">\n\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"row\" style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-8 col-md-offset-2\">\n        <a href=\"?light=on\" class=\"btn btn-success btn-block btn-lg\">Turn On</a>\n        <br />\n        <a href=\"?light=off\" class=\"led btn btn-danger btn-block btn-lg\">Turn Off</a>\n        <br />\n        <div class=\"light-status well\" style=\"margin-top: 5px; text-align:center\">\n          <?php\n            if($light==\"on\") {\n              echo(\"Turn LED on.\");\n            }\n            else if ($light==\"off\") {\n              echo(\"Turn LED off.\");\n            }\n            else {\n              echo (\"Do something.\");\n            }\n          ?>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Part THREE: Hardware: Wire Everything Up\n\nNow that code is written, go ahead and wire things up. To do this I used an FTDI to USB cable. The FTDI cable powers the ESP and connects it to the Serial Terminal. Of course, you can also use FTDI Friend or other FTDI connectors. Here is a diagram of the ESP connected to an LED and an FTDI friend from Sparkfun.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/07/esp8266_led_ftdi_bb.png)\n\nNow, when GPIO0 (the purple wire above) is connected to ground at boot, this tells the ESP to start up in bootloader mode. This is when you can flash the ESP, meaning transfer the Arduino code to the ESP. After the Arduino code is loaded, you'll see a \"Done Uploading\" status message at the bottom of the ArduinoIDE. Then the code will start running. \n\nIf you want to flash another program, then restart the Arduino. You can unplug/replug the USB (which disconnects the Arduino's power source), or you can reset the Arduino by disconnecting the CH_PD (chip powerdown) pin. \n\nIf you don't want to restart the device in bootloader mode, simply unplug the GPIO0 cable (the purple wire above). \n\nWhen are you ready to not rely on the USB cable anymore, just unplug everything that connects to the USB. You can also unplug the GPIO to Ground, since you don't need the bootloader mode anymore. You then connect the VCC (power) and GND (ground) to the red (power) and black (ground) of a battery pack that's 3.3-5V. Something like this:\n\n![](/content/images/2015/07/esp8266_led_battery_bb.png)\n\n## Part Four: Arduino Code\n\nI used the ArduinoIDE to connect with the ESP8266 module. This way, you can flash the ESP just like you would flash an Arduino. It makes developing really easy! \n\nNow, this does not mean you need an Arduino in this example. You are just using the software Arduino publishes which allows you to write program and flash them onto tiny little electronic modules like the many different types of Arduino board and now the ESP8266 module. \n\n### 1. Install the ESP8266 package in ArduinoIDE\n\nFor this, you need Arduino 1.6.4 or higher. You can download the latest software on [Arduino's website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). I followed [Adafruit's tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide) for setting up the Arduino IDE. They used their Huzzah breakout, where as I am using the lowly ESP8266-01. The software part is the same, the only difference as far as I can tell is which pins to plug into which socket in the FTDI cable. \n\nAfter everything is updated, open up Preferences (on Mac it's `CMD+,` or select from the toolbar Arduino > Preferences). Then enter `http://arduino.esp8266.com/package_esp8266com_index.json` under \"Additional Board Manager's URL\" towards the bottom. \n\nRestart Arduino.\n\nNow, in Arduino, you should file under toolbar Tools > Board > Generic ESP8266 Module.\n\nI also followed Adafruit's recommendations on a few other settings:\n\n* CPU Frequency: 80 MHz\n* Flash size: 4M\n* Upload speed: 115200\n* Port: my USB port (this shows up once you plugged everything in)\n* Programmer: AVRISP mkll\n\n### 2. The Arduino Code\n\nOk, now that ArduinoJson is installed, the we can start doing the fun stuff.  I’m going to start off by showing the compiled code. Then I’ll break it down. If you are the type that like to stare at code and learn that way, then just read the following and you’re done! If not, keep going. \n\n#### Including ArduinoJson.h Library\n\nThis basically tells the ESP to ping our `light.json` file. If the latest value for the key `light` is `on`, then turn on the LED. Then rinse and repeat every second. Of course, if the value for the key `light` is `off`, then turn off the LED. \n\nNow, `light.json` outputs its value using JSON. So we need a parser. Luckily, a bunch of really smart people have already done this. So no need to reinvent the wheel. I used [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson). You can find instructions for [installing ArduinoJson library](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/wiki/Using%20the%20library%20with%20Arduino) on their wiki. \n\nThen you include this library with `#include <ArduinoJson.h>` in the file.\n\n#### The \"void setup()\" Section\n\nIn this section, you set a few basic configurations set to your specific values:\n\n1. Your Wifi name and password (the `ssid` & `password` variables)\n2. Your `light.json` URL (the `host` & `path` variable)\n3. Your output pin (we use GPIO2, so `const int pin=2`)\n\nIn `void setup()`, you set GPIO2 pin to Output (the O part of GPIO) and I like to flash it on High just to show that it’s turning on. \n\nYou also begin a Serial connection using `Serial.begin(115200)`. This enables you to interact with it using the Serial port, which you can open with the little Magnifying glass in the top left corner of the Arduino IDE. You can also connect to the Serial Terminal using `screen`, CoolTerm, or PuTTY. I covered different options in a previous blog [post](). When you use `Serial.print(\"something\")` or `Serial.println(\"something\")`, you should see the results in the Serial Terminal. \n\nLast we start connecting to the internets using `Wifi.begin(ssid, password)`. While the ESP is still connecting, I have it delay and then print a dot. If you are watching the Serial Terminal, you’ll see dots appear until you log in. It’s just a way to see that the little ESP is trying to connect. \n\n```\n#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>\n#include <ArduinoJson.h>\n\nconst char* ssid     = \"\";  \nconst char* password = \"\";\n\nconst char* host     = \"\"; // Your domain  \nString path          = \"/path/to/light.json\";  \nconst int pin        = 2;\n\nvoid setup() {  \n  pinMode(pin, OUTPUT); \n  pinMode(pin, HIGH);\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  delay(10);\n  Serial.print(\"Connecting to \");\n  Serial.println(ssid);\n\n  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);\n  int wifi_ctr = 0;\n  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {\n    delay(500);\n    Serial.print(\".\");\n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"WiFi connected\");  \n  Serial.println(\"IP address: \" + WiFi.localIP());\n}\n```\n\n#### The \"void loop()\" Section\n\nNext we start the `void loop()` function, which Arduino will run and rerun. Here, we will connect to `light.json` and print the HTTP response (the info you get from the URL). \n\nThe stuff used in `client.print(...)` is called an HTTP request.  This example is contains a very simple request header, you can look through more complex parameters by reading through the XXX.  \n\n```\nvoid loop() {  \n  Serial.print(\"connecting to \");\n  Serial.println(host);\n  WiFiClient client;\n  const int httpPort = 80;\n  if (!client.connect(host, httpPort)) {\n    Serial.println(\"connection failed\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  client.print(String(\"GET \") + path + \" HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" +\n               \"Host: \" + host + \"\\r\\n\" + \n               \"Connection: keep-alive\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\n\n  delay(500); // wait for server to respond\n\n  // read response\n  int dir = 0; \n  while(client.available()){\n    String line = client.readStringUntil('\\r');\n    Serial.print(line);\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    // NOTE: we’ll replace the line above with something to parse the \n    // JSON response here!\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n  }\n  Serial.print(\"closing connection. \");\n}\n```\n\nUsing the two code snippets above, you should see the HTTP response body in the serial, wait a little bit, see it close and re-open the connection, then see the HTTP response body again. Rinse and repeat. \n\nNow that’s all fine and dandy, but we don’t want to see the HTTP response. We want to turn on an LED! So let’s do that now. \n\n#### Parsing the JSON Response\n\nSo when you run that, you should get something like this as a response. You can see the log of the response in your Serial Terminal.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With\nContent-Type: application/json\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nContent-Disposition: attachment; \nDate: Sun, 12 Jul 2015 18:49:27 GMT\nCache-control: private\n\n{\"light\":\"off\"}\n\n```\n\nThe first section is the HTTP Response header. It tells you what kind of data you’re getting using `application/json`, that the webpage is up and running using `200 OK`, and other useful, informative things. \n\nI’m going to ignore these useful, informative things. \n\nThe next section after the blank line represents the body of the content. On a web browser, this is the stuff that you see. \n\nUltimately for the blinky LED, we only care about the last line (`{\"light\":\"off\"}`), which tells the ESP8266 what to do with the LED. \n\nI’m sure there are excellent libraries out there to parse this thing, but I wrote something quick and dirty to apply to values I know will appear in my JSON file. Basically, I will tell the code to ignore everything past the first empty line. Then skip the line after that (the blank line), then read the line after that (the JSON data). \n\nIf you have a data response with a different structure, this may not work for you. Ok. You’ve been warned. Now let’s continue. \n\n**Warning: crazy-silly-but-it-works hack up ahead**.\n\nWhat I do is introduce a variable name `section`. Using this, I keep track of what section of the HTTP response I'm reading. \n\nThe program then reads the HTTP response line by line. Each line is represented by the variable `line` in the while loop. The default value is `section = \"header\"` since the HTTP Response begins with header. \n\nIt then doesn’t change until it reaches an empty line. When it reach an empty line `if (line==\"\\n\")` then the program sets `section=\"json\"` since the next line will be the JSON line we care about. \n\nWe parse the JSON line next, and store the JSON into a `json_parsed` variable. You can read this in the section after the comments `// Parse JSON`.\n\nAfter this, we turn the LED on or off depending on the result. We use the `strcmp` function (short for string comparison). `strcmp(json_parsed[\"light\"], \"on\") == 0)`, meaning if the the key `light` is set to `on`, then we turn on the LED. We do this using `digitalWrite(pin, HIGH)` line where the variable `pin` is the GPIO number we set in the beginning of the file.  \n\n#### Final Arduino Code\n\n```\n#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>\n#include <ArduinoJson.h>\n\nconst char* ssid     = \"\";  \nconst char* password = \"\";\n\nconst char* host     = \"\"; // Your domain  \nString path          = \"/path/to/light.json\";  \nconst int pin        = 2;\n\nvoid setup() {  \n  pinMode(pin, OUTPUT); \n  pinMode(pin, HIGH);\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  delay(10);\n  Serial.print(\"Connecting to \");\n  Serial.println(ssid);\n\n  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);\n  int wifi_ctr = 0;\n  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {\n    delay(500);\n    Serial.print(\".\");\n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"WiFi connected\");  \n  Serial.println(\"IP address: \" + WiFi.localIP());\n}\n\nvoid loop() {  \n  Serial.print(\"connecting to \");\n  Serial.println(host);\n  WiFiClient client;\n  const int httpPort = 80;\n  if (!client.connect(host, httpPort)) {\n    Serial.println(\"connection failed\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  client.print(String(\"GET \") + path + \" HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" +\n               \"Host: \" + host + \"\\r\\n\" + \n               \"Connection: keep-alive\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\n\n  delay(500); // wait for server to respond\n\n  // read response\n  String section=\"header\";\n  while(client.available()){\n    String line = client.readStringUntil('\\r');\n    // Serial.print(line);\n    // we’ll parse the HTML body here\n    if (section==\"header\") { // headers..\n      Serial.print(\".\");\n      if (line==\"\\n\") { // skips the empty space at the beginning \n        section=\"json\";\n      }\n    }\n    else if (section==\"json\") {  // print the good stuff\n      section=\"ignore\";\n      String result = line.substring(1);\n      \n      // Parse JSON\n      int size = result.length() + 1;\n      char json[size];\n      result.toCharArray(json, size);\n      StaticJsonBuffer<200> jsonBuffer;\n      JsonObject& json_parsed = jsonBuffer.parseObject(json);\n      if (!json_parsed.success())\n      {\n        Serial.println(\"parseObject() failed\");\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Make the decision to turn off or on the LED\n      if (strcmp(json_parsed[\"light\"], \"on\") == 0) {\n        digitalWrite(pin, HIGH); \n        Serial.println(\"LED ON\");\n      }\n      else {\n        digitalWrite(pin, LOW);\n        Serial.println(\"led off\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  Serial.print(\"closing connection. \");\n}\n```\n\n## Part Five? Next Steps\n\nThe next thing I want to do is connect this whole contraption to a stepper motor. So rather than an LED blinking on and off, the ESP can make a motor turn. \n\nI want to have a bunch of little ESPs around the house connected to different motors that can do different things. I mean, a lot of things require turning action: opening window blinds, turning a key, opening a door. My next step is to get a basic motor example working, then we’ll connect the motors to various household components and start robotifying my apartment. \n\n[^n]: Ok, so originally I was using Sparkfun's Datastream. Until that is, literally minutes before deciding to publish this blogpost, the datastream went down. So I waited. And waited. and Finally decided to screw it and rewrite everything using good ol' PHP and JSON. ","html":"<p>In my previous post, I covered how to upload sketches using NodeMCU, which is firmware written in Lua. I ran into a few problems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Uploading big files were prone to error, and it took multiple tries</li>\n<li>Memory! I seemed to not have much</li>\n<li>The callbacks were driving me insane. I decided to not like callback functions for the time being. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In comes Arduino to save the day. There are a lot of useful libraries written for Arduino--libraries for stepper motors and parsing JSON for example. Also, the stepper motors are controlled by Arduino's microcontroller in the end, so it is just simpler to have one language write for both the Wifi Module (ESP) and the microcontroller (Arduino). Last, no upload errors (that weren't my fault).</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I did was blink an LED, because that's simply the first thing you do when you get hardware.</p>\n\n<iframe class=\"imgur-embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GfD93zj.gifv#embed\"></iframe>\n\n<p>On the client side (the page on my phone), the \"Light On\" button sends a \"On\" value to the <code>light.json</code> file.

It either reads <code>{\"light\":\"on\"}</code> or <code>{\"light\":\"off\"}</code>. That's it. Keep in mind though, it needs to be set to permission 777 so the PHP file can write to it (though 666 works too).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"indexphp\">index.php</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>index.php</code> file is the public file that writes <code>{\"light\":\"on\"}</code> or <code>{\"light\":\"off\"}</code> to <code>light.json</code>. Here is the barebones code. There are two links that links you to the current page with a url parameter <code>?light=on</code> or <code>?light=off</code>. Based on the url parameter, the PHP writes the appropriate instructions to the JSON file. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php  \n$light = $_GET['light'];\nif($light == \"on\") {  \n  $file = fopen(\"light.json\", \"w\") or die(\"can't open file\");\n  fwrite($file, '{\"light\": \"on\"}');\n  fclose($file);\n} \nelse if ($light == \"off\") {  \n  $file = fopen(\"light.json\", \"w\") or die(\"can't open file\");\n  fwrite($file, '{\"light\": \"off\"}');\n  fclose($file);\n}\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=\"?light=on\"&gt;Turn On&lt;/a&gt;  \n&lt;a href=\"?light=off\"&gt;Turn Off&lt;/a&gt;  \n&lt;div&gt;  \n  &lt;?php\n    if($light==\"on\") {\n      echo(\"Turn LED on.\");\n    }\n    else if ($light==\"off\") {\n      echo(\"Turn LED off.\");\n    }\n    else {\n      echo (\"Do something.\");\n    }\n  ?&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I merged this code into my handy <a href=\"http://www.nyl.io/template.html\">template.html</a> HTML page to start. This page is preloaded with jQuery, Bootstrap (with simple layout preloaded), and Font Awesome. I don't use jQuery or Font Awesome on this particular project.

To do this I used an FTDI to USB cable. The FTDI cable powers the ESP and connects it to the Serial Terminal. Of course, you can also use FTDI Friend or other FTDI connectors. Here is a diagram of the ESP connected to an LED and an FTDI friend from Sparkfun.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/esp8266_led_ftdi_bb.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now, when GPIO0 (the purple wire above) is connected to ground at boot, this tells the ESP to start up in bootloader mode. This is when you can flash the ESP, meaning transfer the Arduino code to the ESP. After the Arduino code is loaded, you'll see a \"Done Uploading\" status message at the bottom of the ArduinoIDE. Then the code will start running. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to flash another program, then restart the Arduino. You can unplug/replug the USB (which disconnects the Arduino's power source), or you can reset the Arduino by disconnecting the CH_PD (chip powerdown) pin. </p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to restart the device in bootloader mode, simply unplug the GPIO0 cable (the purple wire above). </p>\n\n<p>When are you ready to not rely on the USB cable anymore, just unplug everything that connects to the USB. You can also unplug the GPIO to Ground, since you don't need the bootloader mode anymore. You then connect the VCC (power) and GND (ground) to the red (power) and black (ground) of a battery pack that's 3.3-5V. Something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/esp8266_led_battery_bb.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"partfourarduinocode\">Part Four: Arduino Code</h2>\n\n<p>I used the ArduinoIDE to connect with the ESP8266 module. This way, you can flash the ESP just like you would flash an Arduino. It makes developing really easy! </p>\n\n<p>Now, this does not mean you need an Arduino in this example. You are just using the software Arduino publishes which allows you to write program and flash them onto tiny little electronic modules like the many different types of Arduino board and now the ESP8266 module. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1installtheesp8266packageinarduinoide\">1. Install the ESP8266 package in ArduinoIDE</h3>\n\n<p>For this, you need Arduino 1.6.4 or higher. You can download the latest software on <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software\">Arduino's website</a>. I followed <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide\">Adafruit's tutorial</a> for setting up the Arduino IDE. They used their Huzzah breakout, where as I am using the lowly ESP8266-01. The software part is the same, the only difference as far as I can tell is which pins to plug into which socket in the FTDI cable. </p>\n\n<p>After everything is updated, open up Preferences (on Mac it's <code>CMD+,</code> or select from the toolbar Arduino > Preferences). Then enter <code>http://arduino.esp8266.com/package_esp8266com_index.json</code> under \"Additional Board Manager's URL\" towards the bottom. </p>\n\n<p>Restart Arduino.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in Arduino, you should file under toolbar Tools > Board > Generic ESP8266 Module.</p>\n\n<p>I also followed Adafruit's recommendations on a few other settings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CPU Frequency: 80 MHz</li>\n<li>Flash size: 4M</li>\n<li>Upload speed: 115200</li>\n<li>Port: my USB port (this shows up once you plugged everything in)</li>\n<li>Programmer: AVRISP mkll</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"2thearduinocode\">2. The Arduino Code</h3>\n\n<p>Ok, now that ArduinoJson is installed, the we can start doing the fun stuff.  I’m going to start off by showing the compiled code. Then I’ll break it down. If you are the type that like to stare at code and learn that way, then just read the following and you’re done! If not, keep going. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"includingarduinojsonhlibrary\">Including ArduinoJson.h Library</h4>\n\n<p>This basically tells the ESP to ping our <code>light.json</code> file. If the latest value for the key <code>light</code> is <code>on</code>, then turn on the LED. Then rinse and repeat every second. Of course, if the value for the key <code>light</code> is <code>off</code>, then turn off the LED. </p>\n\n<p>Now, <code>light.json</code> outputs its value using JSON. So we need a parser. Luckily, a bunch of really smart people have already done this. So no need to reinvent the wheel. I used <a href=\"https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson\">ArduinoJson</a>. You can find instructions for <a href=\"https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/wiki/Using%20the%20library%20with%20Arduino\">installing ArduinoJson library</a> on their wiki. </p>\n\n<p>Then you include this library with <code>#include &lt;ArduinoJson.h&gt;</code> in the file.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"thevoidsetupsection\">The \"void setup()\" Section</h4>\n\n<p>In this section, you set a few basic configurations set to your specific values:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Your Wifi name and password (the <code>ssid</code> &amp; <code>password</code> variables)  </li>\n<li>Your <code>light.json</code> URL (the <code>host</code> &amp; <code>path</code> variable)  </li>\n<li>Your output pin (we use GPIO2, so <code>const int pin=2</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In <code>void setup()</code>, you set GPIO2 pin to Output (the O part of GPIO) and I like to flash it on High just to show that it’s turning on. </p>\n\n<p>You also begin a Serial connection using <code>Serial.begin(115200)</code>. This enables you to interact with it using the Serial port, which you can open with the little Magnifying glass in the top left corner of the Arduino IDE. You can also connect to the Serial Terminal using <code>screen</code>, CoolTerm, or PuTTY. I covered different options in a previous blog <a href=\"\">post</a>. When you use <code>Serial.print(\"something\")</code> or <code>Serial.println(\"something\")</code>, you should see the results in the Serial Terminal. </p>\n\n<p>Last we start connecting to the internets using <code>Wifi.begin(ssid, password)</code>. While the ESP is still connecting, I have it delay and then print a dot. If you are watching the Serial Terminal, you’ll see dots appear until you log in. It’s just a way to see that the little ESP is trying to connect. </p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;ESP8266WiFi.h&gt;\n#include &lt;ArduinoJson.h&gt;\n\nconst char* ssid     = \"\";  \nconst char* password = \"\";\n\nconst char* host     = \"\"; // Your domain  \nString path          = \"/path/to/light.json\";  \nconst int pin        = 2;\n\nvoid setup() {  \n  pinMode(pin, OUTPUT); \n  pinMode(pin, HIGH);\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  delay(10);\n  Serial.print(\"Connecting to \");\n  Serial.println(ssid);\n\n  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);\n  int wifi_ctr = 0;\n  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {\n    delay(500);\n    Serial.print(\".\");\n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"WiFi connected\");  \n  Serial.println(\"IP address: \" + WiFi.localIP());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"thevoidloopsection\">The \"void loop()\" Section</h4>\n\n<p>Next we start the <code>void loop()</code> function, which Arduino will run and rerun. Here, we will connect to <code>light.json</code> and print the HTTP response (the info you get from the URL). </p>\n\n<p>The stuff used in <code>client.print(...)</code> is called an HTTP request.  This example is contains a very simple request header, you can look through more complex parameters by reading through the XXX.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>void loop() {  \n  Serial.print(\"connecting to \");\n  Serial.println(host);\n  WiFiClient client;\n  const int httpPort = 80;\n  if (!client.connect(host, httpPort)) {\n    Serial.println(\"connection failed\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  client.print(String(\"GET \") + path + \" HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" +\n               \"Host: \" + host + \"\\r\\n\" + \n               \"Connection: keep-alive\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\n\n  delay(500); // wait for server to respond\n\n  // read response\n  int dir = 0; \n  while(client.available()){\n    String line = client.readStringUntil('\\r');\n    Serial.print(line);\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n    // NOTE: we’ll replace the line above with something to parse the \n    // JSON response here!\n    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n  }\n  Serial.print(\"closing connection. \");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the two code snippets above, you should see the HTTP response body in the serial, wait a little bit, see it close and re-open the connection, then see the HTTP response body again. Rinse and repeat. </p>\n\n<p>Now that’s all fine and dandy, but we don’t want to see the HTTP response. We want to turn on an LED! So let’s do that now. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"parsingthejsonresponse\">Parsing the JSON Response</h4>\n\n<p>So when you run that, you should get something like this as a response. You can see the log of the response in your Serial Terminal.</p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *  \nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With  \nContent-Type: application/json  \nTransfer-Encoding: chunked  \nContent-Disposition: attachment;  \nDate: Sun, 12 Jul 2015 18:49:27 GMT  \nCache-control: private\n\n{\"light\":\"off\"}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first section is the HTTP Response header. It tells you what kind of data you’re getting using <code>application/json</code>, that the webpage is up and running using <code>200 OK</code>, and other useful, informative things. </p>\n\n<p>I’m going to ignore these useful, informative things. </p>\n\n<p>The next section after the blank line represents the body of the content. On a web browser, this is the stuff that you see. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately for the blinky LED, we only care about the last line (<code>{\"light\":\"off\"}</code>), which tells the ESP8266 what to do with the LED. </p>\n\n<p>I’m sure there are excellent libraries out there to parse this thing, but I wrote something quick and dirty to apply to values I know will appear in my JSON file. Basically, I will tell the code to ignore everything past the first empty line. Then skip the line after that (the blank line), then read the line after that (the JSON data). </p>\n\n<p>If you have a data response with a different structure, this may not work for you. Ok. You’ve been warned. Now let’s continue. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning: crazy-silly-but-it-works hack up ahead</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>What I do is introduce a variable name <code>section</code>. Using this, I keep track of what section of the HTTP response I'm reading. </p>\n\n<p>The program then reads the HTTP response line by line. Each line is represented by the variable <code>line</code> in the while loop. The default value is <code>section = \"header\"</code> since the HTTP Response begins with header. </p>\n\n<p>It then doesn’t change until it reaches an empty line. When it reach an empty line <code>if (line==\"\\n\")</code> then the program sets <code>section=\"json\"</code> since the next line will be the JSON line we care about. </p>\n\n<p>We parse the JSON line next, and store the JSON into a <code>json_parsed</code> variable. You can read this in the section after the comments <code>// Parse JSON</code>.</p>\n\n<p>After this, we turn the LED on or off depending on the result. We use the <code>strcmp</code> function (short for string comparison). <code>strcmp(json_parsed[\"light\"], \"on\") == 0)</code>, meaning if the the key <code>light</code> is set to <code>on</code>, then we turn on the LED. We do this using <code>digitalWrite(pin, HIGH)</code> line where the variable <code>pin</code> is the GPIO number we set in the beginning of the file.  </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"finalarduinocode\">Final Arduino Code</h4>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;ESP8266WiFi.h&gt;\n#include &lt;ArduinoJson.h&gt;\n\nconst char* ssid     = \"\";  \nconst char* password = \"\";\n\nconst char* host     = \"\"; // Your domain  \nString path          = \"/path/to/light.json\";  \nconst int pin        = 2;\n\nvoid setup() {  \n  pinMode(pin, OUTPUT); \n  pinMode(pin, HIGH);\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n\n  delay(10);\n  Serial.print(\"Connecting to \");\n  Serial.println(ssid);\n\n  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);\n  int wifi_ctr = 0;\n  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {\n    delay(500);\n    Serial.print(\".\");\n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"WiFi connected\");  \n  Serial.println(\"IP address: \" + WiFi.localIP());\n}\n\nvoid loop() {  \n  Serial.print(\"connecting to \");\n  Serial.println(host);\n  WiFiClient client;\n  const int httpPort = 80;\n  if (!client.connect(host, httpPort)) {\n    Serial.println(\"connection failed\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  client.print(String(\"GET \") + path + \" HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" +\n               \"Host: \" + host + \"\\r\\n\" + \n               \"Connection: keep-alive\\r\\n\\r\\n\");\n\n  delay(500); // wait for server to respond\n\n  // read response\n  String section=\"header\";\n  while(client.available()){\n    String line = client.readStringUntil('\\r');\n    // Serial.print(line);\n    // we’ll parse the HTML body here\n    if (section==\"header\") { // headers..\n      Serial.print(\".\");\n      if (line==\"\\n\") { // skips the empty space at the beginning \n        section=\"json\";\n      }\n    }\n    else if (section==\"json\") {  // print the good stuff\n      section=\"ignore\";\n      String result = line.substring(1);\n\n      // Parse JSON\n      int size = result.length() + 1;\n      char json[size];\n      result.toCharArray(json, size);\n      StaticJsonBuffer&lt;200&gt; jsonBuffer;\n      JsonObject&amp; json_parsed = jsonBuffer.parseObject(json);\n      if (!json_parsed.success())\n      {\n        Serial.println(\"parseObject() failed\");\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Make the decision to turn off or on the LED\n      if (strcmp(json_parsed[\"light\"], \"on\") == 0) {\n        digitalWrite(pin, HIGH); \n        Serial.println(\"LED ON\");\n      }\n      else {\n        digitalWrite(pin, LOW);\n        Serial.println(\"led off\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  Serial.print(\"closing connection. \");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"partfivenextsteps\">Part Five?

[ESP8266-01 Wifi Chip](http://amzn.to/1Lu6QHu)\n2. [Arduino Uno](http://amzn.to/1fhk38N) for flashing the ATtiny85\n4. [ATTiny85](http://amzn.to/1gJgsRW)\n5.

For this project, use a purple or white light (closest to 3.3V). Or you know. Use resistors. You can also use [LEDs with built in resistors](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/0/754-1891-ND) to be safe.\n3. [3.3V Regulator](https://octopart.com/ld1117v33-stmicroelectronics-526800)\n4. [5V Regulator](http://amzn.to/1HDGY7Z)\n5. [9V Battery](http://amzn.to/1HDHrqO)\n6. [9V Battery Connector](http://amzn.to/1MjBPq1)\n\n## Step 1: Prep the Arduino Uno as an ISP\n\nBefore, I had whipped up this whole system with an Arduino controlling the motor instead of an ATtiny85 chip. I learned that you can actually flash some Arduino programs on the ATtiny85 chip, which is AWESOME. The ATtiny85 chip (the thing I'm holding here) is smaller and cheaper than the Arduino. \n\n![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduino_vs_attiny.jpg)\n\nSo adorbs, right?\n\nPrepping the Arduino:\n\n1. [Download the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) if you haven't already\n2. Hook up the Arduino Uno to your computer using a printer cable\n3. Open up the ArduinoISP sketch (File > Examples > ArduinoISP) ![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduinoisp.jpg)\n4. Click \"Upload\" button (the right arrow above the code area) ![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduinoupload.jpg)\n\nThen **BAM**! Your Arduino is now ready to program Atmel Chips!\n\n## Step 2: Add ATtiny85 to Arduino IDE\n\nNow we're going to add ATtiny85 to the list of available boards. This way, you can use Arduino language to program ATtiny85.\n\n1. Go to: Arduino > Preferences ![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduino_pref.jpg)\n\n2. Add this to Additional Board Manager URLs at the bottom and click \"OK\" when done: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package\\_damellis\\_attiny\\_index.json ![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduino_boardmanagerurl.jpg)\n\n3. Go to: Tools > Board > Board Manager ![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduino_boardmanager.jpg)\n\n4. Search for \"attiny,\" click on it, then click \"install\" ![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduino_installattiny.jpg)\n\n5. Restart Arduino\n\n6. Go to: Tools > Board > ATtiny ![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduino_attiny.jpg)\n\n## Step 3: Wire it Up\nWire everything up like so. The Arduino IDE will send the code directly to ATtiny85. Please note the 10uF capacitor. This prevents the Arduino from resetting and starting up bootloader mode.\n\n![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduino_attiny_bb.png)\n<small>(image source: [High Low Tech Blog](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1706))</small>\n\nHere is the pin labels for the ATtiny85 (and ATtiny45)\n![](/content/images/2015/08/attiny_pinout.png)\n\n## Step 4: Code for the ATtiny85\n\nI based this off of [Adafruit's Arduino/Stepper Motor Tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-16-stepper-motors). I made a few tweaks to Adafruit's code. You'll see the changes in where I commented out the original values and why. \n\nGo to: File > New and copy/paste the following code:\n\n```\n/*\nAdafruit Arduino - Lesson 16. Stepper\nModified to take input from ESP8266 instead of user\n*/\n \n#include <Stepper.h>\n \n// NYL: changed the following 4 lines to match ATtiny85's pin number\nint in1Pin = 0; // was 12\nint in2Pin = 1; // was 11\nint in3Pin = 2; // was 10\nint in4Pin = 3; // was 9\nint readPin = 4; // NYL: new line, not in original Adafruit Tutorial\n \nStepper motor(512, in1Pin, in2Pin, in3Pin, in4Pin);  \n\nvoid setup()\n{\n  pinMode(in1Pin, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(in2Pin, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(in3Pin, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(in4Pin, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(readPin, INPUT);  // NYL: new line, listens for input on readPin\n  \n  motor.setSpeed(20);\n}\n\n// NYL: changed this to read input from ESP, \n// then proceed at 32 steps every 1 second\nvoid loop() \n{\n  if (digitalRead(readPin)==1) {\n    motor.step(32);\n  }\n  delay(1000);\n}\n```\n\nFile > Save because you should always save your work!!\n\n## Step 5: Flash the ATtiny85\n\nAll righty! Your ISP (Arduino Uno) is ready. Your code is ready. Let's flash some ICs! 🎉🎉🎉 \n\nGo to \"Tools\" and select the following settings:\n\n![](/content/images/2015/08/attiny_toolmenu.jpg)\n\nJust click \"Upload\" (the right arrow button).\n![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/arduino_upload2.jpg)\n\nThere are some other tutorials on flashing the ATtiny85 you can look at if this doesn't work:\n\n* High Low Tech Blog Posts ([this one](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1706) and [that one](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)) are great. \n* There's also [this post](https://www.hackster.io/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno) on Hackster that is pretty good. \n\n\n## Step 6: Hook Everything Up\n\nLast I hooked everything up to get the motor running off of interwebs bits. I put some scotch tape on the motor so you can see it turning more easily.\n\n<iframe class=\"imgur-embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"404\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mRuKtxu.gifv#embed\"></iframe>\n\nHere's a cleaned up drawing of the wiring:\n\n![](http://blog.nyl.io/content/images/2015/07/esp8266_attiny_noftdi_reg_9v_bb.png)\n\nIn this diagram, the top breadboard power track represents 5V, and the bottom represents 3.3V. The basic logic follows the diagram at the beginning of this blog post. Rather than conceptual arrows, we have wires and breadboards.\n\nNow, if you go to your `index.php` page, you can click the \"Light On\" and \"Light Off\" button. Only now, the light *and* the motor should turn on. \n\nOOOOO... fancy.\n\n## Next Steps \n\nJust when you think you've shrunken everything, there's a way to get things even smaller. For me, the next step is to make a Custom PCB of this and get rid of all the wires and breadboard. \n\nAfter that, I might even start looking into getting the surface mount version of it working, so it's even smaller (and cheaper). At this point, the battery and the motor will be the biggest pieces. So if you guys know of smaller 5V battery and motors, [drop me a line!](mailto: _@nyl.io) ✉️\n\nOk.

The basic logic follows the diagram at the beginning of this blog post. Rather than conceptual arrows, we have wires and breadboards.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if you go to your <code>index.php</code> page, you can click the \"Light On\" and \"Light Off\" button. Only now, the light <em>and</em> the motor should turn on. </p>\n\n<p>OOOOO... fancy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"nextsteps\">Next Steps</h2>\n\n<p>Just when you think you've shrunken everything, there's a way to get things even smaller. For me, the next step is to make a Custom PCB of this and get rid of all the wires and breadboard. </p>\n\n<p>After that, I might even start looking into getting the surface mount version of it working, so it's even smaller (and cheaper). At this point, the battery and the motor will be the biggest pieces. So if you guys know of smaller 5V battery and motors, <a href=\"mailto: _@nyl.io\">drop me a line!</a> ✉️</p>\n\n<p>Ok.

WARHN warhn (failure horn 📢). \n\n![](/content/images/2015/07/failwhale.jpg)\n\n## Problem\n\nSo much trouble trying to figure out what's the issue. The LED would sometimes turn on, sometimes it wouldn't, sometimes the LED would turn on and stay on. I think this indicated that the ESP8266 was frozen. The motor would work maybe 10% of the time. And it was all completely random. I checked my soldering for loose connections. Resoldered a few suspicious (but I think they were fine) connections. Poke and prodded this little green thing with my [multimeter](http://amzn.to/1MuPvhT). \n\n## Root Cause (I think? Maybe?)\n\nI suspect it's had something to do with my 5V Regulator. It seems to be working off a lot of heat. I didn't have a heat sink for it. Trying to debug it let me all over the place. Sometimes it would give me a steady 5V (or 4.9V), other times it would putt along at a 4.2V. I suspect this might be because my 9V battery was losing too much juice too quickly. The 5V Regulator I used ([7805 TO-220](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2164)) needs a minimum of 7V to output a consistent 5V, according to Adafruit product description. So 4.2V output is no go since the L293D motor driver has a minimum supply voltage of 4.5V (and a max of 36!) so that was a no go.\n\nThe other problem was my LED. I got some LED that came with built in resistors, but I think when I soldered them in I soldered them above where the resistor were. So I had to redo the LED. I used a handy white LED the second time since white LEDs have the highest forward voltage. I ended up tearing up the copper traces during this \"fix\" and had to solder in wires manually (see pic below).\n\n## Solution (ish)\n\nTo solve the 5V Regulator problem I decided to just F it and use a different battery pack. I got out my handy 4 AA battery. This starts at a 6V and works its way down to a 4.4V. With a fresh set of batteries it's a little too high for the ATtiny85 chip, which has a max supply voltage of 5.5V. However, it doesn't stay at 6V for long and the batteries I'm using is definitely not at 6V. I then added a manual wire connection between the Input on the 5V regulator and the VCC on the L293D chip. Basically, I bypassed the 5V regulator and plugged the power source directly onto the ATtiny85 and L293D Motor Driver.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/07/pcbmotor_hack_comments.jpg)\n\nIt's probably not the safest or the smartest thing to do.

People who read it seems to like I would like to continue publishing more of these as I venture into different hardware & software projects. \n\nSome projects I'd like to try: Internet Controlled Motor (continued), Keychain/Pendant Gameboy emulator, Alternative Reality App, and so on. As I go through these projects, I visit tutorial sites because the internet is how I learn things these days. Oftentimes, it's hard to glance and get a good idea of what to do in the tutorials. Even on my own blog, I don't think the tutorials and guides I write are that easy to parse.\n\nSo I scrapped together [Guide.js](https://github.com/neuralfirings/guide) to make it easier to write iFixit style tutorial guide. I like their style. It forces writers to have clear images. The bullets make it seem less intimidating. The layout makes it easy to scroll through and get a rough idea before you dive in. \n\n#### Guide Template Features\n\n* **iFixit Style Guides**: big images (optional carousel) on the left side and text on the right\n* **Responsive**: when the screen is smaller, the title bounce above the images and the image becomes full screen\n* **Extensible Main Feature**: Have a step that doesn't involve images?

","html":"<p>Project Github Link: <a href=\"https://github.com/neuralfirings/guide\">https://github.com/neuralfirings/guide</a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Over the past few posts, I've written some guides and tutorials on using the <a href=\"http://blog.nyl.io/tag/esp8266/\">ESP8266 chip</a>. People who read it seems to like I would like to continue publishing more of these as I venture into different hardware &amp; software projects. </p>\n\n<p>Some projects I'd like to try: Internet Controlled Motor (continued), Keychain/Pendant Gameboy emulator, Alternative Reality App, and so on. As I go through these projects, I visit tutorial sites because the internet is how I learn things these days. Oftentimes, it's hard to glance and get a good idea of what to do in the tutorials. Even on my own blog, I don't think the tutorials and guides I write are that easy to parse.</p>\n\n<p>So I scrapped together <a href=\"https://github.com/neuralfirings/guide\">Guide.js</a> to make it easier to write iFixit style tutorial guide. I like their style. It forces writers to have clear images. The bullets make it seem less intimidating. The layout makes it easy to scroll through and get a rough idea before you dive in. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"guidetemplatefeatures\">Guide Template Features</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iFixit Style Guides</strong>: big images (optional carousel) on the left side and text on the right</li>\n<li><strong>Responsive</strong>: when the screen is smaller, the title bounce above the images and the image becomes full screen</li>\n<li><strong>Extensible Main Feature</strong>: Have a step that doesn't involve images? That's fine too.

So for content in a div, you can't take care of all the ==cool== *markdown* styles. \n\nSo, for example, \n\n```\n**I'm bold**\n<div class=\"red\">**I'm not bold, still red though**</div>\n```\n\nwill give you: \n\n<div class=\"red\">**I'm not bold, still red though**</div>\n**I'm bold**\n\n---\n\n## Installation: Markdown-in-Div Preprocessor\n\nSo I made a small Markdown preprocessor. It basically uses img tags to store div info. I use img tags because it doesn't require closing tags. \n\nCopy/paste this in after jQuery in the header but before anything that moves around elements or add elements to the HTML. \n\n```\n<script>\n    // Markdown In Div\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        html = $(\".post-content\").html().replace(/<img src=\"start:/g, '<div class=\"')\n            .replace(/<img src=\"end\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">/g, '</div>')\n        \t.replace(/<img src=\"end\" alt=\"\">/g, \"</div>\");\n        $(\".post-content\").html(html);\n        $(\".post-content\").find(\"div\").each(function() {\n            class_cleaned = $(this).attr(\"class\").replace(\"&\", \" \");\n            $(this).attr(\"class\", class_cleaned)\n        })\n    })\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Example Usage\n\nNow, when you want to open close tag, you can use \n\n```\n ![](start:red)\n this should be red ==with== *formatting*!\n ![](http://)\n```\n\nThis will become:\n\n ![](start:red)\n this should be red ==with== *formatting*!\n ![](end)\n\nooooo...

It basically uses img tags to store div info.
