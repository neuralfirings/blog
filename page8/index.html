        Life in Low Resolution

    <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>It seems like there are more and more designs in low resolution. Maybe I am just pay more attention to low resolution (or low poly) 3D objects because I work in 3D printing.</p>

<p>There is something beautiful in the minimalism of low poly objects. It’s weirdly alien, but organic and natural too.</p>

<p>Maybe people love that real world objects evoke a virtual digital world.</p>

<h2 id="exhibit-1-low-resolution-shoes-by-united-nude">Exhibit 1. Low Resolution Shoes by United Nude</h2>

<p>United Nude is known for artsy, concept shoes. They came out with the <a href="http://www.unitednude.com/lo-res-shoes">Low Res line</a> a while back, and it looks like these shoes are now a staple in their store. Seems like a validation for people’s love for low resolution objects.</p>

    <h2 id="how-expensive-things-can-cost-less">How expensive things can cost less.</h2>

<p>I bought my laptop in 2010. Before this computer, I’ve never owned a laptop that lasted more than 2 years. I’ve also never owned a laptop that was more than $1000. I decided to treat myself and buy a more expensive laptop, in the hopes of having it last longer. If it makes it through Year 3, then I break even. If it makes it through Year 4, then I would have saved money.</p>

<p>Year 3 passed fine. Break even point cleared!</p>

<p>But in Year 4, the issues started. I needed more RAM. My fan was making weird noises. The computer was sloooooooow.</p>

<p>Rather than buying a new machine, a friend helped me upgrade my RAM and replace my failing hard drive with a new Solid State Drive. Last weekend, I replaced my clickity fan with a $15 fan I found on Amazon and free instructions from iFixit.</p>

<p>My computer runs faster than ever at decibels that would please abbey monks.</p>

<h2 id="our-disposable-culture">Our Disposable Culture</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/laptop_1-1.jpeg" alt="Sock designed by Yazmin Alanis from the Noun Project" /></p>

<p>We live in a disposable world of IKEA, paper coffee cups, and plastic utensils. I used to know somebody who would buy hundreds of socks every year, because he only like the feel of new socks. Of course, Sockman is an extreme version of this disposable culture, but he is a good illustration of the disposable mindset.</p>

<p>A New Mindset</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/laptop_2.jpeg" alt="Coffee designed by Jacob Halton from the Noun Project" /></p>

<p>I used to think a lot about the upfront cost of things, and now more and more I am thinking about upfront cost spread over periods of time. I also think more about caring for items I have. If something breaks or tears, how can I mend it first before throwing it away and buying something new.</p>

<p>This mindsets helps me de-clutter. Also, my budget for the individual items can increase as their expected lifespan increase.</p>

<p>Expensive things can indeed cost less in the end.</p>

        3D Printing, Changing the Game by Changing the Players
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Sep 2014</span>

    <p>3D printing is changing the game. Rather, it is changing the players of the game. It used to be that we can bucket players into different segments—designers, shoppers, manufacturers.</p>

<p>With 3D printing, these buckets are starting to leak.</p>

<h2 id="going-from-ampersand-to-slash">Going from ampersand to slash</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/3dpchange_1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A thick and clear line used to divide designers and consumers.</p>

<p>Now, the designer can invite the consumer to co-create via apps. If I customize my own little figurine, am I designing or buying? Both?</p>

<p>It is also now easier for the consumer to start designing. You can more find people to help you model, or follow tutorials and try out 3D modeling yourself. This thins the line between designer and buyer. You can slip from one side to the next, and back again before dinner time.</p>

<p>Essentially, going from talking about shifting the “designers &amp; consumers” paradigm to “designer/consumers” paradigm. And what a change one conjunction can make. A designer/consumer may create something that they may never intend to sell—products that they are using themselves or special items for friends and families.</p>

<h2 id="trial-and-error">Trial and Error</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/3dpchange_2.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>My friends sometimes talk about software speed and hardware speed. Essentially software speed is fast. You write code, push to production (er… I mean staging first of course), and iterate based on feedback. Hardware is much slower. It takes time to get molds made, PCBs designed, and manufacture partners set up.</p>

<p>3D printing does not enable hardware to catch up with software speed, but it does accelerate the hardware process. You can iterate on designs more, and try out different things.</p>

<p>Being able to iterate isn’t just key for seasoned designers. For a new designer, this means you can (more) quickly learn through trial and error. Making a bad model to send to the production facilities isn’t as costly anymore.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-shop">Set up Shop</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/3dpchange_3.jpeg" alt="Stores designed by Joshua Mormann from the Noun Project" /></p>

<p>It is easier now to set up shop. In fact, there are many shops that start selling without even producing. People can post their designs on marketplaces like Etsy and Shapeways, and recently even on Amazon.</p>

<p>You can start smaller and start faster.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-breed-of-professional-hobbyist">A New Breed of Professional Hobbyist</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/3dpchange_4.jpeg" alt="Sewing designed by Cassie McKown from the Noun Project" /></p>

<p>Because it is now more lightweight and quick, setting up shop no longer has to be a full time job. There is a full range of options between a hobbyist and a professional brand selling on these online marketplaces.</p>

<p>Platforms that have traditionally supported designers and sellers now have to support a wider range of entities—corporations, brands, emerging designers, hobbyists, dabblers, and all those nooks and niches in between.</p>

<p>This makes the world more interesting and more complicated.</p>

<p>So who is the “3D printing revolution” for?
This is an important question for all 3D printing companies and especially for startups in this space looking to define their core customer base.</p>

<p>Traditionally, marketplaces and stores might only look at big brands and well-known designers as vendors. Then customers are also in a separate bucket. Now, we also have the opportunity to work with emerging designers, hobbyists, and a wide range of partners. Some of these partner span multiple buckets. The new designers available on Amazon’s 3D printing store range from those designing full time to college engineering students designing to make extra cash for school.</p>

<p>With 3D printing, these buckets are spilling into one another creating a chaotic, beautiful, new type of canvas.</p>

    <h2 id="the-difference-between-good-and-great-pianists">The difference between good and great pianists</h2>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/oldpiano.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Good pianists focus on telling stories. Great pianists focus on how their audience hears their stories. Good pianists play for themselves. Great pianists play for others.</p>

<p>Before I sit down to play a piece of music, I think about what story I want to tell. I craft out where I need to build up suspense, which breaths I want to take, how to sprinkle elements of surprise here and there. I listen to myself play very, very carefully and adjust how I craft the piece.</p>

<p>Then I record myself. Everything changes. Notes sound different. Chords have different colors. The phrasing plateaus too much. The story that I’ve heard all too well is suddenly foreign to me.</p>

<p>I think great pianists are familiar with this chasm between how they hear themselves and how others hear them. When amateurs like me perform, one common critique is that we sound bland. I think the root of this is not that we aren’t interpreting the music or trying to tell a story, but that we don’t think enough about how the audience hears our story. We hear dramatic fanfares while the audience hears cacophonous chords. We hear suspenseful terror while the audience hears schizophrenic rhythms. We hear music while the audience hears notes.</p>

<p>Designing products follows the same principles. Just like how great pianists play for others, great product managers make products for others. They are cognizant of how others use and respond to their products. They are aware of their own biases and what baggage they bring into the design process.</p>

<p>They are playing for others.</p>

<p>Dogs don’t really remember things. You can train them to do things. But, it’s more like training them to develop a habit, like pulling our hands back when we touch something hot.</p>

<p>When they do something wrong and you don’t catch them in the moment, they don’t know to associate your anger or displeasure with whatever it shitty thing they did since they don’t really remember what they did. Even though often that shitty thing is literally a shitty thing.</p>

<p>When you have see that they’ve done a shitty thing after the fact, there’s really no use in getting angry. In fact, it is counter productive. They may look guilty, and we may think it’s because they “know” they’ve done something wrong. In reality, they probably don’t know what specific thing (shitty or not) they’ve done. They just know that this human is pissed off.</p>

<h2 id="i-turn-anger-into-productivity-and-blame-into-responsibility">I turn anger into productivity, and blame into responsibility.</h2>

<p>This makes me re-evaluate how I handle shitty things. Rather than getting angry or annoyed, I now have no reasonable option but to think about what I can do to prevent shitty things from happening. Maybe I have to take the dog out more, or do more training, or this and that. I turn anger into productivity, and blame into responsibility.</p>

<p>There’s no question about it, it’s a more productive way of dealing with a bad situation. It puts me in control of the long term outcomes. That makes all the difference.</p>
