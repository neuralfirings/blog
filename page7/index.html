    <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2015</span>

    <p>For the past month or so, I’ve been playing around with the idea of developing a CAD add on for Blender. Blender is a free and open source tool for animators and game designers. You can make some very impressive 3D artwork with Blender. Some people even use it for 2D animation. While it is good for modeling and sculpting organic shapes, you have to take many twists and turns and make it work for precision modeling, tools commonly found in CAD software.</p>

<p>Take a very basic CAD feature: specifying the length of an edge. In Blender, you have to either use the ruler or edge length tool to measure the edge. Then you do a little division of the target length divided by current length. Then you scale it by the result of that division. Now, I’ve gotten used to this schlep, but come on, it’s no good.</p>

<p>I’ve been noodling around with the idea of writing an Add On for some basic CAD features. I’ve poked around at Blender user groups and forums, just to see if there are interest in such a tool.</p>

<p>I foud, though, that besides a few crazies like me, most Blender users do not need to be super precise. They are modeling animation characters and art, not household component parts that require specific measurements. Because Blender does not have these tools, they tend to not attract these types of modelers. So if I look to current Blender users to validate the need for such an add on, I am perhaps not looking in the right place.</p>

<p>I wonder how often companies and product designers face this issue. They come up with some idea, validate it with their current user base, and end up with the wrong conclusions because they talked to the wrong people. Maybe their product is to solve a problem with non-users and they only talked to current users.</p>

<p>I see variations of this problem at previous companies I’ve worked at, where it’s easier to talk to long time users because they are always accessible and ready to share feedback. But sometimes, product designers need to help new users, not experienced users. And new users face very different problems. We end up improving niche features for a small (but powerful) segment of our community, and miss the big opportunities because we are not talking to new users or non-users. After all, there are a lot more new users than existing users, and there are a lot more non-users than new users. This isn’t to say existing users and power users are not important, but that sometimes we miss other pieces of the pie, or miss opportunities for making a bigger pie. And we all love pie.</p>

<p>PS. If anybody wants to help with Blender CAD add on (developers, testers, people to advocate for specific features you’d find useful), visit https://github.com/neuralfirings/BlenderCaddie/</p>

        Luck is Hard Work
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2015</span>

    <p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/luck.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I once asked a successful entrepreneur what was the turning point of her company’s success. After thinking about it for a few seconds, she said that she was lucky to run into a future investor/mentor at a networking event. That relationship jump started her company into what it is today. I then asked, how many potential investors did you actually meet with before you bumped into this one. And she laughed a little and said, “oh, over a hundred probably.”</p>

<p>Getting one successful meeting after over a hundred failed meetings is not luck. It is [<em>**</em>ing] hard work.</p>

<p>I find that (in America at least), there is an idealization of luck. I suppose it fits with our “quick and easy” mentality. For example, I remember in college, everybody wanted to be the person who could not attend class, get drunk, and whip out a mind-blow works of academic brilliance. Even though behind the scenes, everybody (well many of us) were working pretty hard.</p>

<p>Another case in point, one of my professors told the story of this researcher who noticed a strange pattern of a cat brain scan. Whenever somebody moved their fingers horizontally, specific neurons fired up. This observation later led to groundbreaking research in how vision processes horizontal and vertical imagery. My professor said, “he was lucky to have noticed that.” But here’s the thing—the ability to make these types of observations is not luck. It’s years of hard work to understand how neurons work in the brain, loads of funding to finance these brain scans (and—surprise, surprise—getting research funding is hard work too), and a honed observational skills which highlights the important random neural firings from the random random neural firings. But sure, I suppose you can wrap all that into “he was lucky to notice this thing that happened that one time.”</p>

<p>I think people attribute things to luck for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It makes their achievements seem difficult to attain and copy.</li>
  <li>Attributing things to luck gives them some modesty.</li>
  <li>They just don’t want to go into it all. Writing their achievements off as luck is a quick and easy explanation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the time though, luck is not quick and easy. Luck is hard work.</p>

        Play the Whole Concerto
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2015</span>

    <p>I started working on the second movement of Chopin’s first piano concerto last year. When I learn a new piece, I go through a few lines at a time. I work through each section, learning the notes and thinking about what story I want to tell. This way, I slowly make it through the entire work.</p>

<p>I worked on the last section of this movement for a few days. In the end, I was happy with it. It was melancholic, with a touch of reverie—just as Chopin himself intended.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is not intended to be powerful, it is more romance-like, calm, melancholic, it should give the impression of a pleasant glance at a place where a thousand fond memories come to mind” — Frederic Chopin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I played through the whole piece, and it all came crashing down. The last section—the beautiful section that I had perfected the day before—it just sounded wrong.</p>

<p>It basically told the same story as the first section. The tone stayed the same. It was boring. The story wanted to progressed throughout this movement. I mean, it’s called a movement! It should move.</p>

<p>When I played the whole piece through, I realized the last section is not melancholy at all. Quite the opposite. It is an optimistic restatement of an earlier section. This section told a story of journey’s end, and it was a good journey.</p>

<p>I made the mistake of thinking about each section of the piece in their silos. Each section belongs to a larger movement, and each movement belongs to a larger body of work.</p>

<p>When I work on something—a few bars of music, a feature on a webpage, a press release—it’s always a part of something more. It’s easy to lose sight of the context around which I’m working when I’m focused on one section. But audiences don’t just listen to one section. They listen to the whole concerto.</p>

<p>Even when working on one single note, play the whole concerto.</p>

        3D Printed Mixee Bag

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>

    <p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/mixeebag_wallets-1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I wanted a new bag, so I 3D printed one! Here’s the first ever Mixee Bag. It’s a work in progress, but I think it’s a mighty fine lookin’ start.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/mixeebag_tote.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yes, this bag is fully 3D printed on a desktop printer. And yes, the hinges are printed in place. And yes, it is functional. I’ve been using the cross body version below for the past month walking around NYC. It has replaced my old tote.</p>

<p>I had to figure out how to make 3D printed plastic flexible and, well, bag-like. The triangles are hinged, so the “fabric” can fold.</p>

<p>But why stop at the tote? This is 3D printing after all. And with 3D printing, each print can be customized. So I created a system that can generate different sizes and styles. For example, a cross body bag with a long, twisted link chain.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/mixeebag_crossbody-1.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also made a wallet. Well.. I made a few wallets. There are so many colors to try. By using a heated bed, I can create a smooth and shiny surface. Mmm.. shiny!</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/mixeebag_wallets.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>The clasp is magnetized so the bags and wallets just snap shut, because nobody likes fiddling around with buttons and buckles.</p>

<p>Each side of the bag is printed in one piece. The hinges on each surface are printed in place, so the “fabric” moves and bends right out of the printer.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/mixeebag_printer.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The two sides are then manually assembled together using 3D printed components that snap into place.</p>

<p>I’m still iterating on the design. Trying out different geometries, sizes, colors, chains, hinges, all sorts of fun stuff. So the story of the Mixee Bag is to be continued. Stay tuned!</p>

        How I Started to Code
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>I get this question a lot: how did you learn to code? People seem perplexed that I can make software without a background in computer science. I’ve never taken some 12 week intensive course with a five figures price tag. I did not major or minor in computer science.</p>

<p>How did I learn to code?</p>

<h2 id="goooooaaaaaaallll">1. GOOOOOAAAAAAALLLL!!!!!</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/code_goal.png" alt="Goalkeeper by Juan Pablo Bravo from The Noun Projec" />

During college, my friends and I would sometimes gather to play Bang!, the spaghetti western card game. We would shout in imitation Italian and laugh at each other tripping over rules.</p>

<p>After college, everybody went their separate ways. I had some free time before my job started, so I decided to make an online version of this card game, so we can all gather around our computers and play — just like the good ol’ times.</p>

<p>That was my goal. And it was specific, a true north. It’s easier to get somewhere when you know where you wanted to go.</p>

<p>Oftentimes in class, I do problem sets with the titillating goal of doing problem sets. Don’t get me wrong — these exercises are helpful, but I find it much more helpful when I have a goal that I personally care about driving my education.</p>

<p>I’m not saying if you don’t have a specific goal, you should stop going to class. Learning something is far better than learning nothing. But having a goal you care about and learning as a means to an end is the best of all.</p>

<h2 id="break-it-down">2. Break it down</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/goal_shark.png" alt="Shark by Okan Benn, and Fish by Dan Hetteix from The Noun Project" /></p>

Initially, I wanted to keep things simple. The card game, Bang!, had a lot of rules. Different cards gave players different powers, and certain cards can’t be played more than once, and certain card override other cards, and so on. Well screw that, I thought. I just wanted to make something where I can I can upload card images and manually figure out which card is in my hand, on the table, etc.</p>

<p>I did that, but my job hasn’t started. So I moved onto coding the rules of the most common card. I did that, and my job still hasn’t started. So I moved onto coding the rules of another card. And another after that.</p>

<p>I tackled the game bit by bit. The whole game was complex and confusing, but each bit was manageable. If I thought about tackling the entire game as a whole, I would have turned my computer off on Day 1. But it wasn’t until I was 90% there, that I considered finishing the game. By then, the game didn’t seem all that impossible.</p>

<p>By tackling one bite-sized piece at a time, I also felt more accomplished along the way. It’s the same reason video games have so many levels. Each tiny triumph give you more fuel to tackle the next puzzle. Gargantuan problems, on the other hand, are scary and discouraging. But you know what? A gargantuan problem is just a school of sardine-sized problems huddling together to frighten you, their predator. And sardines aren’t scary.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-google-that-for-you">3. Let me Google that for you…</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/05/code_google.png" alt="Search Engine by Wilson Joseph from The Noun Project" /></p>

<p>Search Engine by Wilson Joseph from The Noun Project
And so how did I translate each bite-sized problem into code? I Googled it. I Googled how to set up a database, how to retrieve of data from the database, how to modify that data, how to keep a counter for score keeping.</p>

<p>At this point, I usually get one of two reactions. Reaction One is the “surprised” face — mouths open and eyebrows raise. This face usually belongs to non-technical people. Reaction Two is the “yup me too” face — eyes close and heads nod. This face usually belongs to technical people.</p>

<p>I first realized the power of Google when I was in college. My computer kept freezing, so I waited for hours to see the computing assistant. Then I watched while the CA fixed my computer. He opened up Google. Typed in the problem. Scrolled down the page. Clicked a link. Found the fix. I was irked. I couldn’t believe I just waisted hours of my precious time waiting in line for the CA. When college-me realized she just lost hours of Facebook time I mean paper-writing time, she pays attention.</p>

<p>Since then, Google has remained my frontline defense against the unknown, whether it’s sourcing manufacturing partners or JavaScript bugs. I say frontline because nothing — not even the mighty Google — is a panacea. You still have to be resourceful. Read books, take a developer friend out to lunch. That said, Google is an excellent place to start.</p>

<hr />

<p>After that, I learned how to code!</p>

<p>Haha, just kidding. The game was buggy. Random cards mysterious show up on the table. The code is horrendous. I actually used the names of tables as a way to store data. I did not learn how to code.</p>

<p>I learned how to approach making a complex website. I gained confidence in tackling the unknown. I did not learn how to code, but I started to code.</p>

<p>My advice for people who want to start learning code is simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a goal you care about</li>
  <li>Break down your idea into bite sized pieces</li>
  <li>Google</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it.</p>
