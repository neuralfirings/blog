        The Myth of Spira
      </a>
    </h1>

    <blockquote>
  <p>“Long time ago, there were a whole lot of cities in Spira. Big cities with machina -machines- to run ‘em. People played all day and let the machina do the work”
— Wakka, Final Fantasy X</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote is about a world where technology has advanced so much that nobody did any work, because machines took care of everything.</p>

<p>I believed that we were approaching that point. I saw technology make things easier and more accessible. Kickstarter made fundraising easier, Etsy and Shopify simplified commerce to a few button clicks… the list goes on. I was hopeful. One day, all I have to worry about is what books to read (made easier by the Kindle) and what movies to watch (thank you Netflix). Even the leisure activities are more accessible now.</p>

<p>But I no longer believe this, because <strong>humans are not meant to be content</strong>. People will find new problems to work on, even when nobody is asking for it. That’s progress.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded/dp/0307465357">Four Hour Work Week</a> for example. It’s a book about how to utilise modern day resources so you can work only a few hours a week and still make a comfortable living. You can “play all day” as Wakka said in Final Fantasy X. Yet, all the marketing and research that keeps Tim Ferriss (the author of this book) busy is way more than four hours a week—probably way more than 40 hours a week. Isn’t that ironic? <strong>The author who prescribes how to work less is actually working more so that he can prescribe how to work less</strong>. Now, I don’t personally know him, but having read his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Ferriss">Wikipedia page</a>, I bet he’s exactly the type of person who can never be content, always moving along.</p>

<p>The Spira from Final Fantasy X is already here, and probably has been here for a while now. But we reject it, because we are not meant to be content. We are meant to improve.</p>

        Writing is Daunting
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2013</span>

    <p>When I was a freshmen in college, I enrolled in a writing intensive humanities program. We were assigned a paper (almost) every week. When my drafts were poor, my professor would recommend the writing tutor.</p>

<p>After visits with writing tutor, my papers were only marginally better. Some sentences sounded clearer. The grammar was less funky. But by and large, the quality remained poor.</p>

<p>See, the issue was not the writing (in its narrow sense) but the thought behind the writing. The writing tutor was there to help us with things like grammar and clarity. He was not there to help make my ideas more insightful, but that is just as important (if not more so).</p>

<p>(I don’t want to belittle the art of quality expression. It is hard. Even when I have quality ideas, I often struggle to communicate them well.)</p>

<p><strong>“Writing well” requires that I use quality expression to usher quality thought into the world.</strong> Half of the battle happens before I put pen to paper (or keyboard to… WYSIWYG editor?).</p>

<p>Having a quality thought is hard. Expression complex ideas well is also hard. Writing requires both which equals hard-squared. And that is daunting.</p>
